7202016;38917982;2015-07-19;28943674;Bianca;Cute and cozy place. Perfect location to everything! 
7202016;39087409;2015-07-20;32440555;Frank;"Kelly has a great room in a very central location. 
Beautiful building , architecture and a style that we really like. 
We felt guite at home here and wish we had spent more time.
Went for a walk and found Seattle Center with a major food festival in progress. What a treat.
Visited the Space Needle and the Chihuly Glass exhibit. Then Pikes Place Market. WOW.  Thanks for a great stay."
7202016;39820030;2015-07-26;37722850;Ian;"Very spacious apartment, and in a great neighborhood.  This is the kind of apartment I wish I had!

Didn't really get to meet Kelly until I was on my out, but she was always readily available by phone. 

I believe the only ""issue"" (if you want to call it that) was finding a place to park, but I sincerely doubt its easy to park anywhere in a residential area after 5 pm on a Friday"
7202016;40813543;2015-08-02;33671805;George;Close to Seattle Center and all it has to offer - ballet, theater, museum, Space Needle, restaurants of all ilk just blocks away, and the Metropolitan (probably the coolest grocer you'll ever find). Easy to find and Kelly was warm, welcoming, and really interesting to talk to. 
7202016;41986501;2015-08-10;34959538;Ming;"Kelly was a great host and very accommodating in a great neighborhood. She has some great coffee and while I wasn't around much during my stay the time I spent interacting with her was very pleasant. 

The apartment is in a great location and very close to the Seattle Center. The neighborhood itself has a lot of good food as well!"
7202016;43979139;2015-08-23;1154501;Barent;"Kelly was great, place was great, just what I was looking for-
clean, simple, well kept place.
5 min walk to the Seattle bike share (as of Aug 2015) which I used all week."
7202016;45265631;2015-09-01;37853266;Kevin;Kelly was great! Very nice and the neighborhood and place to stay was expected and comfortable. Overall great and would book again.
7202016;46749120;2015-09-13;24445447;Rick;hola all bnb erz - Just left Seattle where I had a simply fantastic time for the weekend , no small part because of the welcome mat left for me at Kelly's. all was good and mega efficient, most including precise directions-very important in this town. oh , btw, her cool 50's apt in in the perfect spot to do anything in town with minimum effort. CHEERS
7202016;47783346;2015-09-21;249583;Todd;Kelly's place is conveniently located on a quiet street in Lower Queen Anne which is an easy walk or bus/cab ride to Belltown and Downtown in addition to being a booming neighborhood in its own right. Alas, I was visiting my job and old friends in Seattle so my schedule was completely full and I barely got to meet Kelly. Which is too bad, she seemed great!
7202016;48388999;2015-09-26;38110731;Tatiana;"The place was really nice, clean, and the most important aspect; it was close to everything so we moved across the city easily.
Muy limpio y espacioso, Kelly fue muy agradable y lo mas importante es que esta cerca de prácticamente todo lo que nos permitió movernos fácilmente por la cuidad."
7202016;49441269;2015-10-04;39852826;Tim;"The place was really nice, clean and quiet at night.
Clean Linen and Towels were provided and the air mattress was superb. 
The Neighbourhood is practical with a lot of restaurants and cafes around. Downtown is reachable by foot (30 min) or bus (10 min).
Kelly was a fantastic host, although I was working most of the time, so I haven't had time to talk much to her."
7202016;50490194;2015-10-12;384855;Tony;"The listing was exactly as described!  Kelly's place was wonderful and cleen.  it was just what we were looking for.
We only got to meet her for a moment one evening because of our varied schedule, but she was warm and welcoming to us.
Her place is also in good walking distance to City Center!  Lots to do right around there!
We would recommend her place to others who are traveling to Seattle!"
7202016;53862449;2015-11-13;21607838;Jason;Very welcoming and a nicer place to live in the Seattle area
7202016;54562283;2015-11-21;17052263;Don;Great location, great price, great host! Thanks for the wine, coffee and interesting conversation. You'll definitely see me again when I visit next.
7202016;55212826;2015-11-29;4774006;Vivian;Staying at Kelly's was easy. The location was a block away from public transportation, her place was easy to find, keys were easy to access and timing was extremely flexible. Great for the price - nothing too fancy. One negative: the shower didn't drain well. 
7202016;58268184;2016-01-02;41297839;Travis;Kelly was an amazing host who made the stay very pleasurable. Her location is ideal for anyone visiting Seattle. Highly recommended
3946674;20798623;2014-10-05;9313038;Angeline;Despite our late booking request, Rachel & Jon were very responsive and helpful over email. It was a great place to stay - the location was ideal, the house was clean, well-furnished, the room was cozy, and the cat made good company. Overall, a lovely experience and I would definitely recommend the Farmhouse! 
3946674;21224862;2014-10-13;8385649;Celine;Rachel & Jon have a nice house closed to downtown. The room was clean. The kitten is really nice and friendly. A good place to stay!
3946674;22877803;2014-11-16;9403201;Rémy;"Rachel and Jon have been the perfect hosts for us. Our schedule was very tight and they have been very helpful for the check-in and the reservation.
The house is conveniently located, spacious, and beautiful. The room has space for luggages or coats in a big closet. You are given a spare key, so you're free to go in and out.
We have felt really confortable with our hosts and really recommand this house as a place to stay if you're going to Seattle."
3946674;22938377;2014-11-17;2920596;Jason;This house was a delightful bright place to stay! Rachel and Jon were so nice, they had breakfast for us in the morning. And when we arrived their lovely cat Brigette greeted us and made everything cozy!
3946674;23416253;2014-11-30;23579299;Margit;"Beautiful place, nice neighborhood and lovely couple & cat!
Would definitely sleep there again!"
3946674;23463915;2014-12-01;20706964;Ashley;"Super cozy home. Located near some good restaurants and bars. The only time we really spent at the house was while we were sleeping because we were busy sightseeing on our only day in Seattle, but we would love to stay there again. The cat was an added bonus! 
The only downside was that their room was right next to ours so we felt like we needed to be extra quiet. We also had to wake up very early and we felt bad that Jon and Rachel's room was right next to ours, but I'm sure they're used to it! 
Another bonus was that they had wonderful looking bread and beverages available for us in the morning, but unfortunately we didn't have time to enjoy them! "
3946674;23709531;2014-12-08;23941301;Tim;Cute house, and Rachel and Jon were super nice hosts.  Very prompt communication, clean, comfortable rooms, simple and relaxing decor. Thanks guys!
3946674;23961948;2014-12-15;7008965;Gabriel;Rachel and Jon were really great hosts. Warm, welcoming, and friendly. I felt immediately at ease in their place. The space was very comfortable, clean, and as advertised. They know a lot about Seattle, so are good resources to have when you are there. Their cat is friendly and amusing. I would definitely stay here again! Highly recommended. 
3946674;24118813;2014-12-20;24025530;Davi;"The house was easy to locate and the arrangement to get in works fine even the host was not there when I arrived. 
Everything consistent with the description and Rachel has provided useful information to get around the area. 
It takes a bit more than expected to walk to the downtown though. "
3946674;24302648;2014-12-25;23834617;Tim;Rachel and Jon were very obliging hosts, super friendly and communicative. They gave us valuable tips to explore Seattle and even invited us to go to a concert with them - a super experience! The room and the bed provided enough space for two, very comfortable furthermore. The bathroom and the kitchen were clean and we could find everything we needed. All in all a wonderful stay, there was nothing to complain about at all!
3946674;25275185;2015-01-11;11109842;Michelle;"What a great stay at Rachel and Jon's! They were accommodating hosts and we felt instantly at ease in their home. They were very kind letting our group of four stay at their home, and very flexible with check-in and check-out times. 
The house is warm, charming, and located in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of many of Seattle's sights. "
3946674;26338015;2015-02-09;9997395;Jack;We had an amazing time and felt very welcome in Rachel and Jon's beautiful home. The location was perfect and we could easily walk to one of Seattle's coolest areas. Our room was peaceful and the bed was very comfortable. Overall we had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend this place to anyone.
3946674;27110794;2015-02-25;4920230;Adrienne;It was very easy to get in touch with Rachel to book a space in her beautiful home. She was a very gracious host who shared her morning coffee with us while she was getting ready for work. Our room was very cozy and the rest of the house is open & beautifully decorated - if we didn't have other plans it would have been easy to lounge there all day, especially with their friendly kitty! The farmhouse is located in a great neighborhood that is quite easy to access the city - because the weather was so wonderful during our stay, my friend & I walked to the downtown waterfront which only took about 35 minutes. I would highly recommend staying here - I will again when I return to Seattle.
3946674;27182900;2015-02-27;3002880;Sasha;"Rachel and Jon's home is beautiful and inspiring! We were only there for a brief time but they made us feel at home. And Brigitte, the cat, is the friendliest cat I've ever met. 

The location is very convenient, barely 2 miles from downtown and Capitol Hill. 

Also, You'll have fun browsing through some of the interesting art + doodads around the house"
3946674;28291295;2015-03-21;28621214;Carley;John and Rachel were great hosts. We arrived, opened the lock box, and found our room with no trouble. The neighborhood was quiet but Capitol Hill restaurants and bars were easily accessible. Coffee, fruit, and nuts were left in the kitchen for guests and were greatly appreciated. For a quiet night in Seattle, the Farmhouse is a great option with a very sweet cat!
3946674;28433477;2015-03-23;21176280;Juerguen;"Rachel and Jon were very friendly and flexible. Rachel had baked us some homemade cookies that tasted fantastic after a 7 hr flight to Seattle. Thank you!! The room was great and spot on with the description. There was free wifi and a list of recommended spots to check out while in Seattle. Very clean house and safe neighborhood. 

Their cat is very friendly as well! Five star cat ^_^  

Rachel was very flexible about check out time. It helped us a lot since our flight wasn't until later that night. 

The location is great! near the downtown area.  I highly recommend this place."
3946674;28534479;2015-03-25;26018276;Claudia;Rachel was a gracious host and, though we met her only shortly, she was very friendly. We slept comfortably in the Corner room, that is simply furnished and a bit chilly at night, but also quite private and quiet. They offer complimentary fruit, nuts and drinks for breakfast, which was very nice, especially since they had a dairy-free alternative (delicious hazelnut milk) for lactose-intolerant people like me. 
3946674;28843895;2015-03-30;29870942;Mike;I felt very welcome at Rachel & Jon's house, even though I wasn't able to check in until late. House matched the description, clean and comfortable room, and a very nice cat.
3946674;29873691;2015-04-13;30347816;Arno;Great little home! I felt very, very welcome, ad ended hanging out with Jon and Rachel quite a bit. And the cat was just dreamy.
3946674;30773722;2015-04-27;3474876;Angela;Jon & Rachel were both awesome host and people to meet as well as their sweet kitty. Rachel was there to greet me and even provide guidance on where to visit and directions. Both of them were very sweet and great for insider tips. The place was very convenient and clean. Enjoyed my stay in Seattle. Thank yoU!!
3946674;31599041;2015-05-07;15811536;Emily;Rachel and Jon were really great and their place is clean and comfy. And their cat is so friendly! Good location and great hosts. Absolutely recommend. 
3946674;31748548;2015-05-09;32286824;Ryan;"Rachel and Jon were awesome! I felt welcomed the second I stepped foot in their home. It was almost like I was staying with friends of my own. I had never been to Seattle before, but the insight they gave me about what there is to experience around the city helped shaped my vacation for the best. 

As far as the house itself -- it was beautiful, clean, filled with great art and lush plants.. Just like the photos! The only evidence of their cat was Brigitte herself. There wasn't any pet odor or hair to be found. The house has amazing natural lighting as well. But not to worry, the bedroom has a very heavy curtain for blocking out the morning sun for sleeping in as long as you please. The comfy bed was a great thing to come back to each night after a long day of exploring. Located in the Central District (literally central to everything), I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go and felt very safe doing so. 

They have set the bar extremely high for any future Airbnb experiences. I will definitely try to book with Rachel and Jon the next time I travel to Seattle, and will recommend their listing to everyone I know! "
3946674;31899502;2015-05-11;16342997;Cynthia;"Easy to find and park, close to downtown and the places we needed to go; super convenient! It was also very comfortable, and we especially enjoyed Brigitte, the friendliest cat in the world! We would stay there again in a heartbeat and would love talking to our hosts more."
3946674;33445091;2015-05-28;11015358;Mander;Rachel and Jon were amazing! Sweet sweet duo, with an amazingly sweet sweet kitty, and a cool place in a pretty darn convenient location. Thanks so much for opening your house to us!
3946674;34194163;2015-06-06;4006836;Veronica;We had a wonderful stay at Rachel & Jon's home. They were great hosts and the location was great - walking distance to downtown and a short cab ride away. Highly recommended! 
3946674;35123521;2015-06-15;32870799;Katie;"Rachel was a great host and the room/house was great.  While we were out exploring most of our time there, we felt right at home and at ease where we were staying. 

The neighborhood is just a mile walk (or cheap Uber ride) from downtown Seattle and the same for Capitol Hill area. 

If cats are an issue - don't worry.   I can be sometimes sensitive to cat hair - but you would never know there was a cat in the house.  But she is super sweet but also not in the way if you don't want her to be - but she does like a good petting :)"
3946674;35398735;2015-06-18;33943549;Michael;They were really great!  We got in very late because of a delayed flight, but they didn't mind one bit.  They were both very friendly and really cool to talk to.  We were only there one night on our way up to B.C. but I would have loved to stay with them longer.  Awesome house in a great neighborhood.  Plus, they have a really dope cat.  Highly recommend.  
3946674;35579217;2015-06-20;1928003;Emily;I had a great experience staying at the Farmhouse! Rachel and Jon (and the kitty) were incredibly sweet and accommodating. They let me drop my bags off several hours early so I could make the most of my day exploring Seattle. It was so nice to be able to come and go as I pleased. The house was safe, clean, and down right adorable. As my first Airbnb experience, the bar has been set pretty high!
3946674;37201302;2015-07-05;26170953;Jennifer;Rachel made us feel totally welcome.  She was in close contact with me on the day of our arrival.  Their home is exceptionally beautiful, and our bed was very comfy.  She did everything possible to keep the place cool (in 95 degree heat!) and offered great suggestions for food and fun in Seattle.  Oh yeah, and the cat was also very cuddly and lovable!
3946674;37338415;2015-07-06;15967204;Sarah;Rachel and Jon's house is a very nice classic Seattle house in a great location. We were there in the middle of a heat wave but the house still kept cool, even though it was 95+ out we had no trouble even napping midday in our comfy room. They left treats and snack out and had a very friendly cat that we enjoyed napping with. We missed paths on the way in but met up on the way out and lo and behold we knew each other from high school! We had a great time sipping coffee and catching up and will definitely check back in for future Seattle trips.
3946674;38295437;2015-07-14;30544873;Lisa;Rachel & Jon were incredible hosts! They were both very friendly, open, easy going and their hospitality was far more than I could have ever hoped for. They both offered tips of where to go, what to do, where to shop and how to find what I was looking for. They even shared the fruits of their labour blueberry picking, and helped me make coffee in the morning. It made my first weekend of school that much more enjoyable knowing I was returning to somewhere that felt like home.
3946674;39176070;2015-07-21;34858362;Cheryl;"This was my very first stay at an Airbnb and it was lovely.  I chose the Corner Room at the Farmhouse because of its proximity to my daughter's apartment.  Rachel & John were very nice and made me feel welcome in their home.  The bed was extremely comfortable, so I slept great, and I learned how to use the French Press to make coffee.  The house is clean and sunny in a nice neighborhood. 
I will definitely stay at The Corner Room again the next time I visit.
"
3946674;57111968;2015-12-22;37096823;Ethan;"Rachel and Job were great hosts. Their home was not only clean and welcoming, but very beautiful. In terms of location they're nestled between downtown and Capitol Hill so commuting was relatively easy (note: we relied on cabs and Lyfts). To top it all off they have an adorable cat Brigit who was utterly delightful to spend time with. 

Would recommend/stay again!"
7833113;44472406;2015-08-26;34123551;Stephanie;"Kelli was an amazing host and immediately opened her hospitality to my boyfriend and I. She welcomed us into her apartment and gave us the run down on Seattle. She even went out of her way and provided for us a huge and informative lists of many of the highlights of Seattle. My boyfriend and I really wanted to experience the coffee, beer, and food scene of Seattle, and Kelli covered it all perfectly!

The location was perfect and ideal for first timers in Seattle. Pike Place and the Seattle Center  (Space Needle and Chihuly) were just a short walk away.  Fremont was also a slightly longer walk north from Kelli's. Lastly, Kerri Park where you can receive one of the best views of the Seattle skyline was also very close!

Overall Kelli was a phenomenal host and I highly recommend her for anyone visiting Emerald City!"
7833113;45156782;2015-08-31;13316300;Matt;"First and foremost Kelli went out of her way to install a keybox to make this whole trip way more convenient. It's apparent she cares about those she hosts.

When we arrived the apartment was clean and comfy. We found our cozy bedroom to be very accommodating. My wife and I had no problems sleeping with the futon that was folded out. It was surprisingly comfortable. Kelli provided pillows, towels, and everything we needed for the night. The room's decoration was really cool. 

The neighborhood was great and we didn't feel like we needed to go far for anything we needed. Attending PAX was a breeze.

When we finally met Kelli on the final morning she was warm and welcoming. We got to meet her dog who is a little bundle of love. I have no reservations about staying with Kelli again."
7833113;45704944;2015-09-05;7354543;Nicola;Convenient location close to Music Museum. Easy to find. Nice and tidy.  Host gave us a lot of good suggestions of vegetarian places to eat and punk bars. Turns out we had lots in common. 
7833113;46177947;2015-09-08;16840700;Stuart;"Kelli made my friend and I feel extremely welcomed, her place is really nice - very clean :) The locations is great to get around to some really cool areas in Seattle either on foot or on bike and we had a blast.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Kelli's place to any friends heading Seattle way"
7833113;46752160;2015-09-13;23038979;Carmen;"Kelli was so sweet and made us feel welcome right away. She had the cutest sign on the kitchen blackboard that read ""welcome carmen."" :) 
Her place is super clean, well decorated, and has everything you could ask for. In addition the location is fantastic. You cannot go wrong booking with Kelli! "
7833113;47506180;2015-09-19;32505575;Wanda;The house is really clean and nice, the location is good. Kelli gave us lots of suggestion where to go and good to eat. We had a great time to stay at Kelli's house and with her cute dog. Definitely recommend it. 
7833113;48404791;2015-09-26;6181790;Joe;I really liked staying at Kelli's place. She was a warm, friendly and very helpful host. Her place was nice and clean and I felt welcomed. It was a great location and easy to get around.   She has a kitten and a dog which were adorable. After staying at Kelli's for 10 days, I really felt comfortable and relaxed.  I really enjoyed my visit to Seattle. Thanks!  Joe Sparks
7833113;49817108;2015-10-06;2618477;Nobu;"Kelli was a great host. Nice, very helpful - an overall awesome lady! We were a little late getting in, no problem. Thanks for the record shop and restaurant recommendations!

The apartment was very clean and decorated beautifully. An easy walk to Belltown and beyond, we barely used the car.

Fantastic, highly recommended, thank you!"
7833113;50456359;2015-10-12;9151574;Taylor;This listing was perfect for our stay in Seattle. We were walking distance from the Space Needle as well as a ton of restaurants, coffee shops and bars (which Kelli had great suggestions for). The room looks exactly like it did in the pictures, if we are ever in Seattle again, we would stay here again no question.
7833113;51903847;2015-10-25;42635470;Venus;Kelli was an absolutely wonderful host!! Kelli went out of her way to make sure we knew how to make the most of our stay in Seattle. If we ever needed directions, a restaurant suggestion, or any other advice, Kelli was more than willing to help, and was never more than a text or call away. Plus, Kelli had a map, and newspapers and lists of all the places to go to in Seattle ready for us as soon as we arrived. The location of Kelli's home is amazing! Just a few minutes walk away from major attractions, and steps away from bus lines. Walking distance to excellent restaurants. We loved our beautiful and very comfortable room. We slept very well, and we had no privacy issues at all. Kelli keeps her home impeccably clean and dust-free, which I really appreciated as an asthmatic. My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time in Seattle thanks to Kelli and her beautiful home! And her doggy, Desi, was super cute and sweet. It was very hard to leave Seattle after having such a great time. Thank you so much Kelli!
7833113;52494233;2015-10-30;17958206;Armelle;Very good location, and Kelly is very nice! She gave us a lot of advices and we had a great time in Seattle, and in her apartment! Thank you so much! I miss Charli!
7833113;52843867;2015-11-02;34796223;David;Kelli was great!  Super hospitable and very kind.  Loved the way she decorated her place.  Thanks Kelli!  God bless!
7833113;54857057;2015-11-25;25044118;Arianna;We had a great time staying at Kelli's place. The room was a good size for 1-2 people. It was clean and ready for our arrival. She was very helpful, she provided advice about restaurants and places to visit. We would definitely stay at Kelli's again if we were in town again.
7833113;55361093;2015-12-01;2830204;Jess;Great room, great location and great host. The room is clean and private, the rest of the house is also very clean and Kelli is accomodating when sharing space (lounge room, kitchen and bathroom). The location is very close to a major shopping centre and the space needle (walking distance) also close to buses to downtown. Kelli knows her city well and is there to help you enjoy it- she had lots of helpful hints and tips.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend. 
7833113;55916043;2015-12-07;7560156;Elaine;"Kelli was an amazing host and made my first Seattle experience very memorable! The location couldn't have been better -- it's only a few blocks away from the iconic Space Needle and a slew of cultural hubs. There are fantastic restaurants steps away from the apartment and Kelli has recommendation dishes for all of them. In addition, there are multiple bus stops just around the corner to bring you to farther places for sightseeing. For example, the University of Washington and Arboretum was about 40 minutes away. 

Kelli is just the sweetest, which is further proven by the scrumptious freshly baked cookies she offered me during my stay. Also, she has an adorable kitten who will surely melt your heart! When I accidentally left my charger after boarding the plane, she even mailed it back to me. Couldn't have asked for a better host <3"
7833113;57119975;2015-12-22;28662643;Kady;"Kelli is such an awesome host. From the moment we booked with her she was so helpful in answering questions and giving suggestions. She was there to meet us and had all sorts of maps/guides to help out. She also pays attention to details with the chocolates/mints in the room to the fridge space provided and even tea. 

The place is an old building but in such a terrific area - easily you can walk to some of the major sights (ex. Space Needle, Key Arena, the monorail, etc). The room & bed were comfortable and true to the pictures. There was wifi and a tv for you to kick back and relax on the couch with. So if you want a place to have a nice hot shower and a good sleep after a long day out, this is a great place for you. 

If you're lucky enough you'll also get to meet Charlie, who was such a friendly and lovable kitten - and we're normally not even cat people! :) "
8308353;47014896;2015-09-14;1964916;Jeff;"Courtney was so welcoming, I immediately felt at home.  The cats ranged from very friendly to friendly to indifferent.  The second-floor room was beautiful, with lots of light, good views, and the bed was great.  The house is in easy walking distance of Gas Works Park (I was attending a wedding there) and all that Stone Way has to offer.

I highly recommend staying here!"
8308353;47427199;2015-09-18;20997974;Anna;"We felt very welcomend in courtney and adams adorable house. The room is bright, cozy and you can spot douzens of  squirrels in the garden. 
The house is in a nice neighbourhood and in walking distance to the famous freemont troll.
They gave us useful hints for seattle (especially the breakfast place was amazing!)
All over we had a wonderful time and would definetly stay again.  
Thanks a lot. matthias and anna"
8308353;47602193;2015-09-20;5790065;Joss;Great place, fantastic hosts. Definitely what AirBnB should be. The room was large and comfortable, and Adam and Courtney were super friendly and accommodating of my odd schedule.
8308353;48810422;2015-09-28;28531622;Amy;"This was a beautiful bright room with two windows and to the floor drapes.  The hardwoods were spotless and the bed was comfortable.  I highly recommend this space.  The hosts did not see me much but were friendly and helpful when I did see them.
"
8308353;48957529;2015-09-29;28592890;Thomas;It was magnificent!   The place was beautiful and in a convenient neighborhood.  Adam and Courtney were as nice as could be and so was their cat.  We hope to see them again.
8308353;50103944;2015-10-09;23360768;Ariel;"This was a fantastic stay. Courtney is an awesome person, their place is great, she and Adam are very accommodating and friendly, the location is convenient, plus her french press and choice of coffee is pretty delicious. ;) Highly recommended!!"
8308353;55606734;2015-12-03;44239286;Kenneth;I stayed with Adam & Courtney for about 2 months while I was working at the University of Washington (about 2.5 miles away, easy to reach by bus/biking/walking). I had a great stay. They're both warm, welcoming people that go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The house is located in a residential neighborhood (quiet & safe), but not too far from downtown Seattle (20 min by bus or so?), the U district, Ballard, Wallingford... Especially the last two are nice if you're looking to a nice place to have lunch/dinner. I would definitely recommend staying with Adam & Courtney!
4277026;23284049;2014-11-27;12849861;Paul;Philip was a great host! He made us a map of the area with a curated selection of personal favourites. Every place we tried at his recommendation was sublime. We jammed together and went to a few shows. It felt like visiting an old friend more than just your average impersonal AirBnB experience. The room was nice, a little sparse maybe but we weren't spending a huge amount of time there. the location was one of the best parts as there are a ton of great spots within 2 blocks. I'll definitely be staying again next time I hit up Seattle.
4277026;25402633;2015-01-14;25892167;Dennis;My girlfriend and I stayed with Philip for two nights. It felt like staying with a real roommate and not like staying at a hotel. It was easy to connect with Philip through our love of music and we had some interesting conversations. So if you're looking for a place to feel like being home with a friend and not just only stay there to spend your nights I would highly recommend to stay with him. The neighbourhood (capitol hill) is cool too, there are a lot of good bars serving craft beer and some really good coffee shops.
4277026;28765134;2015-03-29;29994885;Zach;I didn't have the chance to meet Philip this time around, but I was delighted to have his roommate Mara as a host. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay.
4277026;33527609;2015-05-29;17272550;Derek;Didn't have chance to meet Philip in person during my stay but he has arranged His roommate Mara to be my host, she was incredibly accommodating through my stay. Everything walkable within 2 block and can find a great place to dine or coffee or you can take the bus at Broadway to downtown area which is  convenient ...
4277026;33821397;2015-06-01;5350854;Martin & Carolin;"The apartment is located in the nice old building in a fun part of the city. Everything is very walkalbe. 
Philip gave us great advice on the area and his housemate Mara made sure that we felt welcome."
4277026;48696344;2015-09-28;38521340;Peter;"Amazing stay, great place and a cool host! I would recommend this to anyone!
"
4277026;49320462;2015-10-03;14952850;Lu;I spent 3 days here at Philps' apt, didnt get to meet him but the lovely roommate Mara made sure everything is ok. quite and nice area but near to everything，u wont regret this ；）
7735100;42962443;2015-08-16;40442846;Rebecca;Roger definitely made us feel welcome by accommodating our late-night check-in and responding quickly to any questions we had during our stay. The location of his place is great for walking anywhere in Fremont and we loved the recommendations he had for the area. There was plenty of room for all of our things and the place was spotless.
7735100;43837578;2015-08-22;40603512;Puhong;我们是一家三口，可爱的女儿，夫妻二人都是中国来的访问学者，来到美丽的西雅图，住在了Roger的房子里，房子位于美丽的艺术小镇fremont，有各种各样的雕塑，还有宇宙中心的路标，各种小店的橱窗也是充满特色，富有艺术气息。安静美丽的小镇，充满了秋天的味道。离西雅图市区比较近。房子位置好，能从窗户里看到Rainer山。很不幸我们没有看到。
7735100;44469361;2015-08-26;19864124;Scott;"This room was PERFECT for me and fit my needs exactly. It's nicer than the hotel rooms I stayed in during other legs of the trip and definitely fit the budget better. It's a bedroom in a 3-bedroom apartment duplex. Rumor has it that someone lives in at least one of the other rooms, but I didn't see them during the two nights I stayed here. The bathroom is attached to the bedroom, so that's convenient. And this place is located in a very cool neighborhood within walking distance from tons of great spots. I even walked all the way to Pike Place Market from Roger's place and it was a breeze. 

My only warning is that there isn't a lock on the door to the bedroom. I wasn't concerned about this but others might be. I'm traveling solo and don't have anything super valuable sitting around the room, but keep that in mind. 

All in all, the place is rad and Roger lives next door and works 5 minutes away so he's nearby in the event of any major problems."
7735100;45354751;2015-09-01;6093501;Matko;pretty room in a nice neighbourhood. we didn't meet roger as we came in really late and left early, but he sorted everything out. comfy bed, enough privacy, and we would have had a nice view through the window had the weather been better. a definite recommend.
7735100;57419048;2015-12-25;13019539;Tibor;The host canceled this reservation 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4701141;28471216;2015-03-24;3285646;Sarah;Miesha was great. It was a long term stay that ended up going a little longer while I was trying to find a place to live, but she was extremely accommodating in every aspect and made sure that I felt welcomed at every turn. Fantastic host and super location if you want to get to downtown easily, or anywhere else in Seattle. 
4701141;53902378;2015-11-14;26208231;Lindsey;"I recently moved to Seattle and have been staying Miesha's guest room while searching for a more permanent living situation.  The room is spacious and the bathroom is like a spa including heated floors and towel warmer.  

Miesha is a wonderful host.  She is helpful and communicative and her home is comfortable. When I arrived, she made sure that the furniture in the room included what I needed for my stay.  She switched out a chair and added a desk which I have used quit a bit.  She worked with me to extend my stay and was very accommodating of my ongoing search.  Plus, she keeps plenty of coffee on hand which has kept me going on even the rainiest of days. I can't imagine finding a better place to stay while starting out my life in Seattle!  I highly recommend this room."
7934963;49148626;2015-10-01;37444544;May;"I stayed with Farah and Ben for almost a month— and it was a great experience!
They are both easygoing people who will chat with you if you want, or just let you do your own thing if that’s what you’re feeling. They always checked in with me to see how I was doing, and if I needed anything. I had space to store food in the kitchen, was able to use to w/d, and had a little spot in the bathroom for my things there. The location is also very conveniently near a bus stop that takes you to downtown, and the neighborhood itself is nice and quiet. Lots of street parking, and I felt very safe the entire time I stayed there. Overall, I would say a long stay with them would feel very much just like staying in your own house— very convenient, very easy. 
Would definitely stay with them again!"
7934963;49512452;2015-10-04;26750734;Logan;The house and room were clean and nice. Farrah and her boyfriend were friendly. Would definitely recommend.
7934963;50105565;2015-10-09;4107277;Celena;Farah made us feel very welcome in her home. She was excellent at communication and tips and the room was just as described. The neighborhood is safe and she is near an excellent grocery store, coffee shops and bus stop. We were in town to do a class and so had to leave early each morning. As mentioned, this listing has a shared bathroom but at the time of our stay there were 5 of us trying to get ready in one bathroom all at the same time to all leave by 7am. I guess we just assumed it would be us and her using it only.Farah did her best to schedule the times that each person could use the bathroom. I would take into consideration your trip and daily bathroom time use when booking this listing. With that said, you cant beat the price and value for the seattle area.
7934963;50367910;2015-10-11;9556062;Lisa;Farah was a great host.  She provided little touches that made one feel welcome such as a night light in the living room, and a towel for your stay.  She was very prompt to reply during the reservation process.  Her home provided all that was needed for a short stay.   
7934963;50608166;2015-10-12;14164556;Sarah;The house was awesome, everything was as described, the bed was very comfortable. Farah was super helpful and communicative!
7934963;50908355;2015-10-15;19805575;Alex;Farah was a great host. She welcomed us after normal check in hours because we could not make it early in the day. The room was as pictured, she provided towels for us and the room was clean. 
7934963;51083272;2015-10-17;37442102;Bennett;"Farah was very accommodating for us. We needed to stop by a little earlier than the listed check in time, and she was more than happy to figure out a time that worked for both us and her. The location was incredibly nice! Ballard is such a cute area, and we were in good walking distance from a lot of different businesses and cute shops.
"
7934963;51330898;2015-10-19;44806559;Paulina;Farah was very accommodating and understanding. We fell in love with the place! The outside of the house is a cute baby blue color and it was absolutely adorable! Prior to our stay, Farah reached out to us and made sure she had all of our toiletries available to ensure our Airbnb was perfect. The house was clean and very homey! 10/10 would recommend :)
7934963;52284544;2015-10-27;46879903;Sandra;"Wonderful experience for my first Airbnb! The space is clean and somewhat minimalist tho' comfy/cozy, which was perfect for this trip!  A lovely neighborhood with restaurants etc within easy walking distance. Ben and Farah are personable and engaging, offered great suggestions for restaurants, tho' provided privacy and non-intrusion also as needed.
The only bathroom is a shared one with the hosts, but it really wasn't a problem as only slight scheduling communications took care of it.
I will return here again when in the area, and would recommend this space to friends who might travel there as well.
Thanks for a great first experience!"
7934963;52811074;2015-11-01;31351853;Philip;Fatah was great, room was just as described and the location was very nice. Would recommend to anyone who needs a quick place to stay.
7934963;53288901;2015-11-07;10387535;Shari;The house was in a very quiet Ballard neighborhood. The listing was exactly as I found it. Farah was a very welcoming, friendly and pleasant hostess.
7934963;53428793;2015-11-08;938231;Drew;Farah was more than welcoming. She made us feel right at home. The bedroom was large and quiet. There was plenty of free street parking and downtown was only a seven minute drive away.
7934963;53726144;2015-11-11;8873291;Caroline;"
We had a great stay at Ballard Bliss. Farah was always fast to respond and the place looks just like the pictures. It is basic and clean. 
 The neighborhood was nice and quiet. It is walking distance to grocery store and many restaurants and stores.
We would recommend Farah's place to anyone who needs a basic place to stay close to Seattle.

"
7934963;53796206;2015-11-12;48452038;Spencer;The stay here was very comfortable. Farah was accommodating with our arrival time and welcomed us when we got there. We were pretty exhausted after a day of driving and exploring Seattle so we went into our room and slept pretty quickly. It was only 8:30 or so when we decided to go to bed, but the house was very silent even though it was so early, so we really appreciated that! I would recommend this house to anyone who comes to Seattle! Thanks, Farah!
7934963;53867186;2015-11-13;25477273;Nisma;We had a wonderful & comfortable stay at Farah's. The neighborhood was literally few blocks from the market area (restaurants, stores, coffee shops, bars) yet it was so quiet. It was great to share travel stories with Farah :-) 
7934963;54004552;2015-11-15;45549036;Susan;My trip up to Ballard and staying with Farah was very pleasant.  I met her when I arrived and they showed me everything that I asked for. I forgot a towel and she supplied me one.   I did not arrive until the evening  and went to bed early and woke up early, so I did not have much contact with them. The neighborhood is a very quite.  I slept very well.  I will stay here again when I come back for another workshop.  
7934963;54217135;2015-11-16;9640217;Abbie;Great room and welcoming host! The house was very clean and quiet. Ballard is a really cool neighborhood to stay in - close to the center of Seattle but with street parking and cool shops/restaurants to explore. Thanks Farah!
7934963;57109210;2015-12-21;3929249;Keith;I had an comfortable but short stay at Farah's place, and enjoyed talking with Farah and Ben.
2934389;15402820;2014-07-08;7682798;April;"This was my first experience with AirBnB, and I have to admit I was a little nervous. But, Bonnie was a delight and made me feel comfortable and very much at home.  

Prior to arriving in Seattle, Bonnie was extremely attentive to my emails and answered all of my questions immediately. We quickly establish great lines of communication which made me feel very much at ease. 

Upon arrival, she was very flexible with our check-in time and greeted my boys and I at our car.  Once in the home, she was very thorough with her tour, and left us with a welcome letter, and details to some important responsibilities.  I felt very comfortable chatting with her and felt that she and I could very easily hit it off as friends. 

It was obvious that Bonnie spent a lot of time thinking of ways to make us feel at home. Age appropriate toys were left out for my boys, a bowl of fruit was filled for us to enjoy, beautiful accents of fresh flowers and plants filled the space, and a wonderful selection of LP's were at our finger tips, just to name a few. The place was every bit as beautiful and inviting as the photos, and the energy of the home was so relaxing. 

Bonnie's attentive and thoughtful hospitality has set a high bar. I hope that other hosts are just as welcoming as she was.  She and her Urban Tree-house will be first on our list for our next trip up to the PNW.  "
2934389;17998079;2014-08-20;10849699;Dee;Serene apartment, exactly as described.  Bonnie was the perfect hostess who didn't miss a detail.  My family stayed for 6 weeks in the summer, and it was a perfect home away from home.   very convenient to parks, buses, shopping, etc.  Note there is no TV, but grab a book and pot of tea, coffee, listen to music, play piano, and enjoy Seattle.
2934389;18744067;2014-08-31;4582507;Carolyn;The apartment was exactly as pictured, and we enjoyed the adorable Mapleleaf neighborhood. It was a bit far from other downtown areas but since we had a car it was not a problem (and parking was a breeze). Bonnie's wonderful friend Stephanie checked us in and everything was very smooth. Thanks Bonnie!
2934389;21170252;2014-10-12;3394000;Christy;Bonnie was available for check in and had definitely listened to the purpose of my trip and schedule and was ultra-accomodating to that. The apartment was exactly as pictured and described, but with extra hospitality. This feels like a Bohemian artists loft and is so comfortable and charming. You do not feel like you will break anything or can't touch and all the decorator and guest touches are just perfect! I hope Bonnie will welcome me back as this location is perfect for my office which is 1 mi away at Green Lake. The freeway access is easy and it's a nice neighborhood. And Thank You, Bonnie, for the little treats you left for us--especially coffee :)
2934389;37470618;2015-07-07;18898726;Megan;"Check-in was a breeze. Bonnie was very responsive and had suggestions of things to do in Seattle over a holiday weekend. The space was cozy, and it was a very welcoming space for a family with children. There is a great coffee shop across the street, as well as a park within walking distance.

We stayed at the apartment during a Seattle heat-wave, so the older building ended up being a little stuffy without A/C. Fans and open windows helped during the nights."
2934389;39048252;2015-07-20;36426521;Daniel;We enjoyed our stay very much. The condo was very clean and spacious. The neighborhood is nice, with a park, and Cloud City Coffee right across the street is a great place. Bonnie made us feel welcome. Check-in was easy. We would stay in Bonnie's place again.
2934389;39624554;2015-07-25;4526575;Tania;We enjoyed our weekend in Bonnie's apartment. She was prompt and proactive in all communication, and the space was clean and just as advertised. We especially appreciated the thoughtful details like the amenities. Oh, and Bonnie has a stellar book collection! I went to bed every night with a pile of classics to browse. Overall we enjoyed our stay.
2934389;40891244;2015-08-03;2631519;Chad;Bonnie's place was the perfect base from which to explore Seattle. Having a 10-year-old in tow, it was really nice to have the huge park next door. You're only about 10 minutes from downtown Seattle, but the Maple Leaf neighborhood offers plenty of dining options if you don't want to be bothered with making the trek. The place was spacious, bright and clean with plenty of room for our family of 3. I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about not having a TV, but we whiled away our downtime listening to records or surfing the Internet via w-fi. So I guess you could say no complaints! Overall, a great AirBnB experience.
2934389;42005770;2015-08-10;7684479;Christine;Sweet little apartment with modern conveniences in a nice, quiet neighborhood. Bonnie left memos and supplies for our convenience and was a prompt replier to the questions we had. We recommend her apartment to other AirBnB users.
2934389;44937231;2015-08-30;124401;Adrienne;Wonderful place to stay. Amazing location, great apartment, lots of books and legos/wooden train set for a kid. Very peaceful and Bonnie was responsive and easy to communicate with. 
2934389;45850926;2015-09-06;39893003;Peng;Very nice apartment with diversified art and craft. Comfortable and cozy feeling at home. Super convenient commuting to the city. Bonnie is very nice and patient about all questions we had about the apartment. Will definitely come back next time. 
6888107;36727603;2015-06-30;18779691;Jordan;"In short, an A++++ listing, would stay here again in a heartbeat. 

If you're considering staying here, reserve it now before it's too late!  You won't find a cuter, more clean place in West Seattle, or nicer more considerate hosts.

My wife and I arrived in Seattle late, and Hamlin and his wife Amy were gracious enough to stay up and welcome us when we arrived at midnight.  There is plenty of street parting, and their condo is nestled between other condos across a grassy well groomed walkway.   

The house itself is so charming and immaculately decorated and clean.  We were there for our 1 year wedding anniversary, and they had even gotten us a bottle of wine!  So thoughtful! 

The room is downstairs, and again is very clean and welcoming.  We had access to a washroom on the main floor, and a full bathroom upstairs which has to be the absolutely cleanest bathroom I have ever seen in a house ever.  

Depending on the day, you may be woken up by the padding feet of their two adorable kids, who were so cute and well-behaved, (at least when we were around =).  

Hamlin and his wife Amy were so considerate, and we had no trouble at all coming in and our of the house at different times of the day, and they respected our privacy to the utmost. 

All in all, an great experience."
6888107;39225364;2015-07-21;37224080;Andres;The place was nice and clean. Hamlin and his wife were very helpful and they would text back right away.
6888107;39967788;2015-07-27;7560288;Amy;"Hamlin and his wife Amy offer a very comfortable home with clean accommodations and a welcoming environment. Although we were on the go 90% of our trip, they were eager and willing to provide us with amazing suggestions, travel tips and even took time out to research bus information for us. The little things that can make city traveling a little tricky, were a breeze thanks to their assistance and advice.  Their home is conveniently located near a bus stop that makes it easy to get to and from the city, and neighborhood is close to the beach, and in a quiet safe setting.  We also had the need for street parking and found a close by spot for our van/trailer rig everyday when we returned. 

Their kids made the stay especially enjoyable and fun. They are full of energy and life, but they were also very respectful of our space and we never felt like our privacy was compromised. The bedroom where we stayed was downstairs providing us a quiet nook to rest in after our long city days. Hamlin and Amy even left us a bottle of wine to enjoy while we were there and made us feel like friends, not just passing through! 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay with the Ham Fam again!"
6888107;41419145;2015-08-07;37619912;Terry;Great stay!! My family and I stayed with the Ham Family and we had a super experience. It was a clean and welcoming home in a super location. Hamlin and Amy are amiable, terrific hosts and their 2 young children are very well behaved. They were always ready and able to happily assist with anything we needed and had great recommendations. We loved our stay!
6888107;41987934;2015-08-10;37705950;Nicole;Amy and Hamlin were extremely gracious hosts. Upon arrival, Amy gave us a tour of their home and made us feel very welcome. The couple provided us with everything we needed, from a shelf of fridge space to two super comfortable beds. The family was respectful of our privacy yet readily available when we had questions. Overall we had a great stay in a great neighborhood.
6888107;42881097;2015-08-16;37098127;Anthony;"The Ham Fam were excellent hosts! We were given a tour of their home and were provided with everything we needed. We were pretty much out and about the bulk of our trip, but Amy and Hamlin were both happy to assist us and respected our privacy—they even lent us an umbrella on the stormiest day of our vacation!

Their home was beautiful, clean, and definitely cozy! The neighborhood was quiet, welcoming, and very cute. The area is nestled right behind a library with the most convenient bus stop that takes you straight downtown.

Our trip in Seattle was extremely enjoyable and we could attribute a good slice of that to having such awesome hosts and a beautiful, convenient place to stay at."
6888107;43670340;2015-08-21;10001611;Thamer;"I really love the stay at Ham Fam's. Ham Fam was so nice and cute. The place was very clean and neat. The place is about 15 minutes from downtown by car which is very close! :)
They provide us a place in the refrigerator, towels and you can use the laundry machine.

Thank you Hamlin and Amy for making our stay in Seattle wonderful and memorable :)"
6888107;44847335;2015-08-29;379337;Angela;We had a great stay! The house was easy to find & Amy was very hospitable, sweet and friendly! And we love her kids, they were so adorable. The Hamlins provided many things for us including towels, toothpaste, shampoo, fridge space and even extra bottles of water for our trip! Our room was spacious, clean and quiet. We would definitely come back if we are back in Seattle again!
6888107;48105640;2015-09-23;29245019;Bryant;My girlfriend and I had a great experience staying with the Ham Fam in Seattle. We came to Seattle seriously considering a move to the city and our stay with Hamlin and his family confirmed it for us. We enjoyed talking and getting to know them. They were very helpful and knowledgeable about Seattle. Their house is beautiful and very well kept with a very comfortable room for guests. Getting around with public transportation, Uber, and water taxi were all easy from their location in West Seattle as well. Definitely recommend this listing!
6888107;49706992;2015-10-05;17784822;Michael;Very sweet welcoming family in an interesting part of town. It's the right balance between sharing, nice conversation and living independence as we both went about our daily routine. Cute house with lots of interesting art, color and intellect. Great french pressed coffee.
6888107;50188069;2015-10-10;41940291;Stefan;"Amy and Hami have been some amazing hosts.
For most of the time we had the pleasure to deal with Amy. She is wonderful with kids. As we were travelling with our one year old daughter, staying at tha HamFam was perfekt for us. They even could provide us with a ""baby-bed"".
Even before our arrival they've been very helpful giving us some different options of how to get to their place.
The room and the entire house were very clean and located in a good neighborhood. Just a 20 Minute busride to downtown. The bus stop is close by.
Thanks Amy, Hamlin, Annabeth and Hami - you made Seattle worth a trip"
6888107;52346550;2015-10-28;23372725;Chenwen;The place was nice and comfortable to stay. Amy and Hamlin are great hosts and my friends and I felt very welcome. Amy helped us a lot when we were staying. I'd to stay again.
6888107;53347989;2015-11-08;45284991;Mijung;We love Hamlin's family house. The house was very clean and nice, and the family was great. They made us comfortable, and we felt it was our own house. The neighborhood was also very quite and safe. We found it relaxing walking around the neighborhood every morning. I would recommend this house!
7075357;40353174;2015-07-30;32694387;Kris;We contacted Rob and he has great communication with us on the details of the place. We decided to book it. At the time of check-in, Rob came greet us and explained about the room. The room was very nice and clean as we expected. It is like what is in the pictures. We love the location of this room as it is close to everything such as highway and attractions. There are some coffee shops and grocery stores around the places. So far, we really enjoyed our stay.
7075357;41790628;2015-08-09;3119483;Matt;"Rob is the ultimate host!  Really took care of us and made sure we had everything we needed, and then some.  Can't thank him enough.

His place is awesome - everything is new and works perfectly.  Very comfortable condo, and great neighborhood full of things to do and packed with locals.  A close jump to downtown, Capitol Hill, north Seattle, etc.

And that Kevo thing still blows my mind."
4494948;23178201;2014-11-24;23550301;Marco;Justin has been a great host. Before we arrived in Seattle he sent us directions on how to get to his apartment, and he waited for us downstairs, so it was very easy for us to find the building. As we stepped into the apartment we felt quickly like at home. This is a cozy apartment, clean and with good taste in decorations. Justin offered some fruit, beagles and orange juice, which were very much appreciated. The apartment itself is awesome and you will feel like you don't want to go out. We had planned to eat out every day, but in the end we bought some food at the nearby QFC and cooked at home several times. I particularly enjoyed the projector. If you have a netflix account you can enjoy movies in a home theater setting.  Neighborhood was also great, 5 minutes walking distance from many happening places, stores and bars, and 15 minutes (or less) walking to the Pike Market Place. I definitely recommend this Justin's apartment for a short of long stay in Seattle.
4494948;23916185;2014-12-14;8190182;Anna;Beautiful apartment, impeccably clean and located right between downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill. Justin was very accommodating especially when my travel plans changed at the last minute. He provided toiletries as well as bagels, fruit and juice for breakfast. Overall a wonderful experience, would recommend and also stay again.
4494948;24854866;2015-01-03;8291197;Ashley;"The apartment was great. The location was fabulous: easy walking distance to downtown, Capitol Hill, South Lake Union etc. Apartment was roomy, extremely clean and has an awesome view of Mt Rainer. Kitchen was well appointed, and there is a big projector TV. No complaints at all. 5 stars.

The one slight negative was parking: its a bit difficult/pricey to park. This is really nothing to do with the apartment, just First Hill."
4494948;25210780;2015-01-09;20037108;Linda;"Great stay!  The apartment is really nice, comfortable, and quiet, with everything I needed. I really appreciated the bagels, orange juice and bananas; also the fast internet, shower supplies, and free laundry facilities. Thanks for the helpful instructions for arriving from the airport. Easy walk (~10 min) from light rail and the conference center; even closer to restaurants and coffee shops. Thank you, Justin!"
4494948;25571953;2015-01-19;22335644;Shelley;We had a very pleasant stay at this beautiful Condo. Everything was clean and tidy. Justin was very flexible with us having an early arrival! He provides  bagels, orange juice, & toiletries for your stay. The projector in the living room is pretty awesome! View is great. Downtown is walking distance. Wish we could've stayed a little longer. Would definitely stay here again. 
4494948;26009294;2015-02-01;10680187;Jason;Justin meet me at the front door and was very friendly. Justin place was very nice and clean!  His place is super close to the bars and downtown. When back in Seattle I would stay in his place again.
4494948;26312330;2015-02-09;16580948;Tim;Justin was a great host.  The room was just a described
4494948;26529949;2015-02-15;23082563;Lauren;"Very pleasant experience. The location was convenient and the apartment was clean and comfortable. 

My boyfriend and I went to seattle for valentines weekend and this spot was perfect! Justin even had a bottle of wine and box of chocolates waiting for us. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! "
4494948;26784515;2015-02-19;26038811;Jeffery (Jincheng);The condo was very neat, well-kept, and cozy. The interior decor was on point! Justin provided bagels, cream cheese, bananas and juice, which was a nice touch. Wireless internet was included. The area was in a convenient location and a quiet neighbourhood. 
4494948;27318359;2015-03-02;17466858;Rodolphe;It was just perfect. The flat is well situated and beautiful. Justin has just settled everything perfectly (some complimentary food...). The flat is absolutely clean. Next time I am back to Seattle I will stay there for sure! Thank you Justin!
4494948;28161985;2015-03-19;26027495;Semele;Best Airbnb experience to date!  Justin left very detailed instructions on how to get in and once in,  we discovered he left us a fresh bag of bagels/cream cheese/ orange juice.  The place was prestine condition and the small touches presented a true bnb experience.  If we are ever in Seattle,  we would definately stay at Justins again!
4494948;28695629;2015-03-29;22890359;Fiona;I had a great time at Justin's place. Justin was very helpful, responded quickly to emails and gave great instructions, so finding the apartment was no problem. His place is about 10 minutes' walk from downtown, and it is clean, smart and well equipped. The bagels, orange juice and bananas kept me going for most of my stay! Couldn't imagine a better place to stay - I'd definitely recommend it and would stay there again. Thanks for a great stay!
4494948;29366732;2015-04-06;10827446;Gabe;"Justin's apartment felt like nothing short of a home-away-from-home while I stayed there for my business trip to Seattle. As a roomy 1-BR, it's more than enough space for a solo traveler, though I'm sure a couple would feel plenty comfortable as well. The furniture is classy and cozy, the bed is fantastic, kitchen is beautiful, and the home theater HD projector is awesome for throwing a movie up on the wall in what feels like your private movie theater.

To top it off, Justin was an ideal host. Before I arrived, he was extremely detailed and timely in his responses to my questions about parking options, wireless internet, etc. And once I arrived, I was welcomed with fresh bagels & cream cheese, fresh fruit and OJ. Plus, he had a clear home essentials instruction sheet, along with a Seattle tourism guide, both printed out and waiting for me on the kitchen counter. Really made it feel like a classic B&B experience.

All in all, a true 5-star property with a 5-star host."
4494948;30067225;2015-04-17;24674650;Kanwalai;I really had a good time in Seattle which Justin's condo is one of the big reasons for that. It was a perfect home away from home for us. The room was well-equipped, clean, beautiful and in a great location just like the description and pictures. It takes very short time to walk to downtown and if you need a bus, the bus stop is just a few steps away from the building. There are drug store, convenient store, restaurants and fast food shops nearby. Justin is a great host, being kind and flexible with us. I really recommend this place to everyone coming to Seattle! Thanks to Justin again for such a nice place. 
4494948;30921949;2015-04-29;529153;Belinda;"We can tell Justin is a considerate person from his way of welcome - fruit, begal, OJ, drinking water, well equipped kitchen, a clear map of Seattle on the wall and even a Seattle landmark chocolate bar.  You'll feel like you're at home.  
Justin's apartment located in a quiet area that surrounded by some nice apartments, two pretty historical houses and plenty of green.  You can walk esaily to downtown or take bus #2 that is one block away to Kerry Park of Queen Ann at where you'll have fabulous view of downtown Seattle especially the Space Needle."
4494948;31870328;2015-05-11;18425414;Alysia;Justin's apartment was the perfect base for our short stay in Seattle. Perched on the top of First Hill, it is easy walking distance to a local shopping strip on Broadway and to downtown/the waterfront (if you don't mind a bit of a steep walk- we did see busses whiz by too). The place itself was very comfortable, well equipped for cooking and was extremely clean and well presented on arrival- he was even so kind as to leave fresh bagels, OJ and bananas. We had excellent communication with Justin and met him on arrival. A fantastic host and we can't recommend him enough.
4494948;32149850;2015-05-14;1600273;Steve;Justin's a great host.  Unlike a lot of AirBnB hosts, he provides hotel-style amenities, down to the little bottles of shampoo.  Which is nice.  His place is also very clean and very centrally located. Highly recommended.
4494948;32992377;2015-05-24;26394059;Joshua;Our stay at Justin's place was amazing. It was a perfect size for two and in a great location! There were plenty of visitor resources provided by the host and even some breakfast items for our stay! The bed is very comfortable and the space is great! I'd recommend Justin's place to anyone looking for a Seattle getaway!
4494948;33564536;2015-05-30;25568993;Shadd;"From booking the room, to arrival, and through checkout Justin has been a great host. He was quick to answer questions about the rental, and give advice on best routes to take from the airport. Unfortunately we were not able to meet Justin in person, but he gave clear and easy to follow instructions on where to pickup the keys and how to get into his building. 

Upon entering his condo, we were welcomed with cold refreshments, bananas, bagels with cream cheese, and orange juice, which was very thoughtful and appreciated. 

The condo was clean and true to the pictures the posted on the ad. The place is well furnished and all of the furniture was in good condition. The kitchen was well equipped; anyone planning to cook during their stay would be impressed. The bathroom was also very clean and Justin even left travel size toiletries for us to use. The bed/couches were very comfortable, and there were plenty of blankets/pillows for us to use. We were fortunate to have great weather for the duration of our stay, and even at 80° the condo was very nice with the windows open. There was also wi-fi and Apple TV which was awesome. 

Location of the condo was was also good. It is uphill from the downtown attractions, but was not unmanageable for me or my girlfriend, even with out luggage. There were also plenty of food and market options within short walking distances. 

Street parking was a bit difficult.  However, there are several overnight pay parking lots just a block or two away which we utilized. 

Overall, my girlfriend and I were very happy with our stay at Justin's condo and will probably look to stay here again for our next trip to Seattle."
4494948;35071274;2015-06-15;28370219;Greg;Justin was a super host, helping us understand the layout of Seattle and the walkability of his condo. When we arrived, the condo was exactly as depicted in the photos - extremely clean and well-organized, nicely furnished and quite comfortable.  As the other reviews mentioned, Justin had various amenities on the counter for our arrival - toiletries and laundry detergent (pack lighter and do laundry just down the hall), a parking pass and map, a Seattle guidebook, along with bagels, cream cheese, and not-from-concentrate OJ, which helped us enjoy the first morning without having to go out for breakfast. Enthusiastically recommend Jason as well as this condo.
4494948;35446299;2015-06-19;18938730;Mary;In town for a Baseball game at Safeco.  thanks for loaning us your parking pass so we were able to leave the car behind and walk just about everywhere.  We even walked to the Stadium but ubered back. The apartment was perfect.  Clean, safe and comfortable. Thanks again.  Hope to make it back soon
4494948;36021396;2015-06-24;5306140;Marc;Staying at Justin's apartment was one of my best airbnb experiences to date.  The location is great.  I enjoy walking around cities and the apartment is located an easy walking distance to downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods.  The apartment is nicely furnished, very clean, and very comfortable.  Justin had a welcoming package with food, toiletries, and laundry soap.  He was waiting for us when we arrived from the airport which made check-in a breeze.  I would highly recommend this property.
4494948;37466201;2015-07-07;33025409;Evan;Great apartment located near some iconic Seattle Landmarks - about a 20m walk from a lot of great places, like Pike Place, Pioneer square, etc. Justin left some snacks and instructions in the apartment as well which was very nice.
4494948;37974824;2015-07-12;33084027;Craig;Justin was very accommodating and met us at the condo just as scheduled. He was extremely pleasant during our meeting and was more than kind and considerate when showing us the apartment. Detailed instructions were left which made it very easy to make ourselves at home for the time spent in Seattle.
4494948;39002586;2015-07-20;6618190;Vince;"All the good comments about Justin and the place are true. When I asked if he had a coffee grinder and he didn't have one, he bought one and a coffee press for my use.  He got bagels, OJ, and cream cheese, too!  
The location is just a 10 minute walk to the public market and downtown.   You can uber to Space Needle for minimal fare. Just right.
You can't go wrong with this place."
4494948;39915884;2015-07-27;22993542;Hannah;Justin was really welcoming and a fantastic host. The apartment was even better than described and we really appreciated the bagels and OJ. Perfectly clean apartment, comfortable bed and plenty of space for 2 people. Using the big screen to watch netflix was an awesome bonus too! Although it's a 15/20 minute hilly walk to the centre of Seattle, this didn't matter as the apartment was so nice.
4494948;41744421;2015-08-09;32798041;Elizabeth;Everything was so awesome - comforts of home, all the amenities, nice neighbors, close to many good food/coffee places. We would come back and stay here in a heartbeat. I would easily choose this place over a hotel room any day.
4494948;43743736;2015-08-22;13017777;John;"Justin's apartment is very nice. Well equipped kitchen. Newly decorated. Comfortable bed. Note about the bed: it is a foam mattress. We were concerned at first, but it turned out to be very supportive. We are older, 60+, but the mattress caused us no discomfort or next-day-soreness. The apartment is not as ""dark"" as it looks in the photos.  The big windows let in a lot of light. The views are basically of neighboring buildings, but you can see Mt Rainier (on a clear day, if you get one). The building is an older apartment building, but it has been well cared for. The neighbors were quiet and nice. Justin was very helpful and responsive.

On the location: we were surprised that ""First Hill"" was not called ""Cliff Side."" It is downhill to everything and parts of that hill are very steep.  It is one mile to the waterfront, most of which is a hill. We walked everywhere and the end of the day was always uphill. So be aware of that. If you rent a car, parking is available on the street, but not always easy to find. There are time limits and fees for street parking. The building is located beside several hospitals. There are emergency vehicle sirens all the time. And there are the normal city noises: traffic, voices, etc. Justin's windows block most of it, but if you like to have the windows open, it can be distracting.

The neighborhood is great: mostly residential in the immediate area, but within 1/2 - 1 mile to everything Seattle has to offer: coffee shops, great restaurants, shopping. Capital Hill has it all, even a pot shop. Capital Hill is very LGBT friendly, so if that bothers you, stay away. But there is no in-your-face gayness.

I give this apartment a very positive review. And affordable by Seattle standards."
4494948;45052173;2015-08-31;13598687;Paul;"Justin's place was awesome! It's in a wonderful location in Capitol Hill area full of great bars and restaurants. If you're looking for an LGBT friendly area, this is it! You're also a 15 min walk from downtown and it's super convenient to get to the Washington State Convention Center it's an easy walk away. 

Justin was very communicate and gave simple directions to enter his place without him being present. It couldn't have been easier. He was very courteous and a quick communicator. 

Justin's condo was in impeccable shape. Very clean, organized and nicely decorated. You can't miss the 100 inch projector which made for some epic nights of relaxation and Netflix vegging. In short, the place really felt like home and the complimentary water, fruit, and bagels was a nice touch. 

I will definitely be staying here again when I make it to Seattle again! Thanks Justin!"
4494948;48378739;2015-09-26;26366177;Steven;The listing was accurate for what truly is an amazing place, the location is perfect within 5 min. walking distance of Washington State Convention Center as well as everything in downtown Seattle and host was fantastic by ensuring everything one could need for a comfortable and enjoyable stay was available (i.e. - towels, soap, shampoos,hairdryer, etc.). Would highly recommend for anyone coming to downtown Seattle.
4494948;49692970;2015-10-05;19514204;Robert;"Justin is a fantastic host. His instructions for arriving allowed for a seamless and stress-free arrival. Upon entering, his place was in fantastic condition. The place was spotless. In addition to the snacks and drinks he had left, he provided an information sheet with all the pertinent information. He also provided a list of places to visit, grocery stores, and pharmacy. 

Overall, I had a 5 out of 5 experience. I will definitely stay again on my next visit."
4494948;50976118;2015-10-16;948664;Christian;"Justin Was a great host!  The apartment was immaculately clean,
very comfortable and, honestly,  better than expected.
He provided everything I needed and more (laundry soap, lots of clean towels, great suggestions for local restaurants) .  The bagels and fruit were an awesome touch.  "
4494948;57923833;2015-12-30;50291659;Dom;"This was our first AirBnB experience. For us, any future stay will be hard pressed to top it! Our host and I communicated often prior to arrival. Every aspect of the visit was as expected or better - from arrival to departure - from the neighborhood to the condo.  Location is easy walking distance to nearby medical center, coffee shops, other neighborhoods and downtown which made it convenient for us to connect with family living nearby. Between walking, public transit and Uber, we had no need to rent a car for the two weeks. The condo is well kept and was a comfortable refuge each night after a long day out and about. All in all it was a very pleasant experience.
"
3242605;14214395;2014-06-14;4134112;Patt & Jacq;The Zen Den was the perfect spot for our little getaway. The private room in West Seattle was a peaceful retreat after a full day of touring the city and Jessica made sure to make us feel welcome while we were in her home. Public transit was nearby, as were shops and restaurants. Would love to stay again if we were visiting Seattle.
3242605;14318943;2014-06-16;5488246;Justine;We stayed at Jessica's for only one night. The room was perfect. The kitties were cute and welcoming. We didn't actually meet Jessica, but even from afar she was really helpful. We will definitely recommend the place.
3242605;14997013;2014-06-30;19457;Ron;Jessica was a bright, cheery and accommodating host for us . . . very flexible in coordinating with our schedule that kept changing because of relatives coming from out of town. The room looks just like the photo. Didn't get to use the sauna, but it looks very nice, has digital settings. The area is super safe and quiet, more quiet because the room is clear at the back of the lot. Best night's sleep I have had in a long time.
3242605;15245290;2014-07-05;6592943;Matt;Awesome host! Awesome place! Nice cats. Would love to stay there in the future! 
3242605;15292756;2014-07-06;16911097;Andy;THe zen den was nice and clean, we weren't there long enough to enjoy the sauna but the space is lovely
3242605;15410505;2014-07-08;3836744;Kate;Jessica's zen den is absolutely amazing. Comfiest bed and air mattress for extra guests, wonderful sauna, and beautiful environment. West Seattle is a really fun mix of city and beach town. There's also an easy bus to catch down town, but coming back to such a relaxing part of the city was a huge comfort. Jessica was also so sweet and responsive to all my questions. Overall really great place to stay! I would definitely want to come back.
3242605;15543736;2014-07-11;612554;Nicole;The place was nice and convenient. Crashed there just for the night with my mom and sister on our day trip to Seattle from Portland. Never met Jessica but she provided everything we needed and the place was easy to find. Sauna was nice after a long day walking around town. 
3242605;15776743;2014-07-15;16951543;Dean;Although we did not get to see much of Jessica because we were wandering all around Seattle most of the time, staying at the Zen Den was a great experience. I would definitely go back there again and would recommend the place to others.
3242605;15879028;2014-07-17;4350777;Sonya;Jessica's place was just as described - a green, peaceful oasis in the vibrant community of W. Seattle.  We loved being able to take just one bus to get us where we wanted to go downtown! Jessica was out when we were in, but we felt perfectly comfortable.  We'd definitely stay again.
3242605;16106354;2014-07-22;11630654;Paola;Even if we haven't met Jessica, she left me all the information I need to reach her house. The room was nice and very well situated, close to Alki Beach and only 20 min bus ride from the Downtown.
3242605;16259751;2014-07-24;2947094;Marc & Chanelle;"Great room and a great host. We only saw Jessica the day we got there as she's pretty busy, but we did get to hang out with her for cats which were all sweet and friendly. The neighborhood was great, and it was close to Seattle Centre, which was what we needed.
Room and house were clean and having the outside deck set was nice. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it. Unfortunately we didn't make use off the sauna, so I can't comment."
3242605;16332328;2014-07-25;17015784;Sam;Room was good, super easy access! Had no dramas... The sauna was nice. Cool little place to stay : )
3242605;16485022;2014-07-28;7590327;Lisa;Great clean room, super quiet. Plenty of privacy for a good price. You have to walk outside on the deck to access the bathroom in the main house area, but this wasn't a problem for us. Very close to a cute retail area with lots of good restaurants! 
3242605;16669505;2014-07-31;10935547;Melanie;"Jessica's place is great! The space is very comfortable. There's an outside area to sit and have coffee or hang out. It's separate from the main house, so you have access to the kitchen and bathroom through a side door right next to the Zen Den. 

The location is awesome - just a quick walk to the water or to The Junction (this area of town). Great restaurants and funky boutiques. 

We had our dog with us this trip and found both her house and the neighborhood very dog friendly. Lots of places to walk your dog. It's a 15 minute drive to one of the best dog parks I've been to (Westcrest).

We were visiting friends and family closer into downtown Seattle and the drive was quick and easy every time.

The only downside was worrying about walking into her house to use the bathroom or grab some water in the middle of the night - which is pretty typical for me in general....

We didn't see her much, but whenever we ran into her, she was very welcoming. I totally recommend her space!"
3242605;16795648;2014-08-02;2044688;Mike;The Zen Den is a peaceful and secluded room in the back of the house - the trees helped keep the room cool in the summer heat. Really enjoyed our stay. 
3242605;16993294;2014-08-05;17323287;Thierry;Very good organisation for my stay at Zen Den. We could not meet with Jessica because we were on the road, but I had a very nice night in this very quiet and Zen place. Thank you Jessica
3242605;17352152;2014-08-11;14612228;Jocelin;First let me say this is a great neighborhood! Really fun and everything is walking distance. Alki Beach and Schmitz park are a quick busride away. If you like staying away from tourist trap areas, then this is the place for you. Host was nice and welcoming, gave us fresh towels and everything. We were four, and although it was a bit tight, it was comfortable for crashing out for the night. 
3242605;17711000;2014-08-16;12037268;Jessica;The host made feel at home and welcomed. She has an open personality.
3242605;17769218;2014-08-17;15725848;Jussi;The room was nice and clean and the area was very quiet at night. Jessica welcomed us when we arrived but did not see him afterwards as she was working nights. Nice place and according to description!
3242605;18529618;2014-08-28;4961606;Twila;"The Zen Den was perfect for my stay.  A quiet residential street near friends.  Just a few blocks from West Seattles main street California Ave.  The bed and space is perfect for one person but 2 could easily manage. Easy access to kitchen and bath from deck near the rooms private entrance.  The cats were sweet, friendly and very respectful.  
Jessica was there to welcome me. Checked in mid week when our paths crossed. And was so sweet and thoughtful with gift of a vegan cupcake on my last evening.  Thank you Jessica."
3242605;18878027;2014-09-02;3586528;Courtney;We stayed at the Zen Den for four nights and really enjoyed our stay. The location is ideal for anyone wanting a more quiet Seattle experience. Just a few minutes to Alki Beach and all the bars and shops of West Seattle. The room itself was immaculate and cozy. We never met Jessica during our stay but she was very communicative and thoughtful. Bathroom is shared and in the main house, this may not be ideal for everyone but it worked fine for us and was very clean. Overall I think this is a great airbnb and would love to stay again next time we are in Seattle.
3242605;18963971;2014-09-03;20364893;Megan;I arrived to a lovely welcome card, a bottle of water and basket of necessities, and a pristine room that looked just as delightful as pictured. The neighborhood was great, lots of excellent restaurants less than a mile away, and I had the chance to just unwind and rest as I needed to. The sauna was fantastic, and Jess couldn't have been more helpful. Will definitely go again if I find myself needing a place in West Seattle.
3242605;19126379;2014-09-07;17569762;Nhu;Jessica left us a cute little greeting card which includes the information for the WiFi network. She also provided the basic necessities such as towels and various items such as little soaps and shampoos. There is WiFi, so that's a plus. Just a note, there were two cats that I encountered during my stay. Overall, it was a neat Zen-themed room. 
3242605;19302932;2014-09-09;1312047;Tim;"Jessica welcomed me in person to give me the lay of the land. There was  a handwritten note on the table, and bottle of water for me as well as a little bowl and bottle of water for my dog. Really nice touch. Jessica was great at texting me with updates and checking in (e.g., I could come over early if wanted, where it might be slippery during a rain, etc.). I appreciated that. I didn't see her much after the first intro, but I felt like she was already ready and available.

I thought the room was great and would absolutely stay again. In fact, I think the Seattle PI paper just featured it as a cool place for a potential local staycation. The room is, as noted, a separate place with its own entrance at the back of the house. Very private and quiet. Inside, the warm-colored hardwood and sunset colors make it really warm. The bed was incredibly comfortable, which makes napping very tempting. And I did use the FAR sauna one night, which is a nice bonus. My dog was also with me, and it was simple and easy. As other reviewers note, the bathroom and kitchen are in the main house. It's a 10 ft walk down the deck to the door. I was a little worried coming in the house at night the first time, but Jessica assured me it was expected. I never saw anyone when I went in day or night, and it quickly became routine. If you do want water in the room at night/in general, you could grab a gallon at the local grocery store fora buck like I did.

As for location, West Seattle is great. The main street is a short walk away, with lots of great places for food, shopping. Huge fan of Husky Deli. Great dog park 15 min away, or head down to the walkway along the sound close by or 10 min up by Alki Beach. Great views and people watching. And if you walk around the neighborhood, you can see the Sound a few blocks away. If you want to head into downtown Seattle, you're a 15 min drive away.

I wholeheartedly recommend Jessica and the Zen Den."
3242605;19417660;2014-09-12;7364821;Justin;The room was very clean. The neighborhood was nice and was in a convenient location. The only drawback was having to go outside to get into the main house to use the bathroom, but that definitely isn't a deal-breaker. We never saw Jess during our stay, but she kept in constant contact to give us advice on where to go/answer any other questions. We would, and probably will, stay here again.
3242605;20005887;2014-09-22;16544292;Reginald;This was my first aibnb experience and I loved it (^
3242605;20289302;2014-09-27;19811857;Ivaylo;Cozy and very private space! Close to beach, shopping, main street with restaurants. The only thing little uncomfortable ( and if the weather is cold) is that the bathroom/shower is outside the room, one has to go out through the patio to the main house. 
3242605;20516286;2014-09-30;7155377;Diane;Loved the zen den - very comfy, only saw Jessica when I arrived, very private nice space.  The added bonus for me was the furry companion that kept me company.  Perfect location in West Seattle.  I will stay there again next time I'm in Seattle. 
3242605;20626108;2014-10-02;13396735;Bradley;Jessica created an awesome environment.  This was so much fun and a wonderful Zen stay.  This was such a warm place.
3242605;20928815;2014-10-07;20931989;Laura;"I didn't get a chance to meet Jessica, as I was arriving in the evening and she was out at the time, and I left early the following morning. However, we communicated by email and she was absolutely as welcome, friendly and informative as can be.  I felt very comfortable setting out to her place despite the fact that it's only my second airbnb experience.

The neighborhood is so very sweet, with lovely historic homes, as is hers. Short walk to a cluster of restaurants and bars (around California and Alaska intersection).  Extremely pleasurable setting.

The room is GORGEOUS, warm and restful -- the bed and linens so soft and comfortable. The kitties hanging outside are approachable and friendly if you're interested in interacting. The bathroom/kitchen are only a few steps away, extremely easy access.  All orderly and easy to find what you need. 

I LOVED staying at Jessica's.  She has an obviously strongly individualistic creative/aesthetic sense which makes the space of the room, the area outside, and I imagine the other spaces as well, wonderfully filled with enlivening, interesting, thought-provoking, beautiful images. Recommended with absolutely no reservations!"
3242605;21642335;2014-10-20;2186884;Cosmo;The place was just as described. Although I didn't interact with the host she left a nice greeting card and everything went perfectly. I definitely recommend staying here!
3242605;22263898;2014-11-02;22731095;Ki;I loved this place. The room lived up to its name- a cozy, peaceful, restful space. Beautiful aesthetic and with an infrared sauna in suite- nice touch. Jessica went above and beyond in providing some amenities, such as toiletries, bottled water, slippers and housecoats. There was free and easy access to the washroom and kitchen. I would have loved to meet Jessica, but didn't have the opportunity. Instead, I got to enjoy her charming cats :) (my choice). The place is located in a very cool neighbourhood, just a 15 min drive from downtown. There are great shops, restaurants and grocery stores around. Great value for money- I would stay again.
3242605;23521278;2014-12-03;17242843;Andrea;Jessica is just lovely. Room was exactly as described. A lovely welcome card with all her contact information and bottled water were on the little table on arrival. The location is ideal. You can walk to the Junction, with great shops, restaurants and yoga and public transportation. The views of the water and mountains during the walk are spectacular .jessica responds promptly to all requests. If you want to be in Seattle in a beautiful neighborhood in an adorable house this is the place.
3242605;23715676;2014-12-08;6981697;Sameer;This place does give out really good vibes. Jessica is truly a great host but we missed seeing her. We did see the cats and they became quiet friendly. It was cold and rainy outside but the den was warm. 
3242605;24023772;2014-12-17;9454359;Tony;Room was great! Jessica had everything ready and clean by the time we arrived so there were no issues. Great neighborhood! We walked home from the bus stop late at night on multiple occasions and felt safe. Would rent again!
3242605;24109775;2014-12-20;2879471;Jennifer;My host was very attentive to my needs but not in my face. The zen den was warm and comfortable. It felt like home when I arrived on my way back thru Seattle.
3242605;24296830;2014-12-25;6904515;Christen;The zen den is a cozy room. When we came in it smelled great from freshly lit incense and there was a note card welcoming me since Jessica was not at home when I arrived. I actually did not see her the entire time of my stay but I did meet her roommate Dale briefly. It is a little bothersome to have to go outside from the zen den into the main house to use the bathroom, but it was as advertised. Overall I've of the nicest airbnb experiences I have had so far.
3242605;24537701;2014-12-30;23660822;Debbie;Loved staying at the Zen Den!! Really loved the neighbourhood, West Seattle Alki beach. Great restaurants and places to explore. Travelling with pets is always a challenge and I can say we all had fun. Comfortable bed, easy access to kitchen, friendly cats. I like the laid back feeling. Will come again. Thanks Jessica!
3242605;24964532;2015-01-04;22002597;Chee Lam;It had been a great experience staying over here.
3242605;25269155;2015-01-11;23772513;Ha;This experience was great! The room is exactly how it looks in the pictures posted. Very quiet. It felt like a home away from home. Usually on vacations I have a hard time sleeping but I slept like a baby! It was a good location too, 15 minute ride from downtown and 20 from north Seattle!
3242605;25506204;2015-01-18;25098738;Kate;We had a great stay in the Zen Den!  We didn't get the chance to meet Jessica but she was very responsive to our needs and made us feel right at home.   The sauna is a definite plus on dark and rainy days.  There were a lot of special amenities to the room too like soaps and lotions, robes and sandals, candles and incense, books and games.  Would definitely recommend!  
3242605;26320597;2015-02-09;25317029;Kent And Mary;Jessica made the process very easy. The room is a great oasis, very comfortable and quiet.  I felt at home in the Zen Den.  Thanks Jessica!
3242605;26561801;2015-02-15;7309494;Linh;Staying at the West Seattle Zen Den was a nice getaway. Great for people who love cats/do not have cat allergies! The room is spacious with the sauna attached which was lovely to try out. The bathroom is inside the main house and just several steps outside of the door to the room. We did not get to meet Jessica during our stay, but she made us feel welcome with a box of Valentine's chocolates and a list of fun things to do in the area. We could not get our Wi-Fi to connect but overall we had a really positive experience! Would stay here again.
3242605;26891390;2015-02-21;27123828;Brian;The place is cute, super quiet, in a beautiful neighborhood with an amazing view of the Puget Sound. Just perfect :)
3242605;27022058;2015-02-23;27678236;Christine;Thank you Jessica for a delightful stay, the room was cozy, compfy and clean, even my puppy enjoyed his stay.  I would not hesitate to stay again. Thank you again.
3242605;27478773;2015-03-05;28179578;Sheena;"Jessica is awesome! She is kind, communicative and always attentive to your needs. I love her laid-back attitude. I felt  never felt so comfortable in some one else's house!

 The Zen Den is clean, comfortable and most of all relaxing.  I love the fact that the sauna has a MP3 adapter cord that allows for you to play music from almost any device. She also provided fresh towels and bottled water whenever I needed them!

Her place is a quick stroll from the best places (resturuants, coffee shops, bars etc) in West Seattle and not too far from the water.

I enjoyed every bit of my stay and can't wait to go back!"
3242605;27646117;2015-03-09;24008806;Karen;"We had a very nice experience at the Zen Den in West Seattle, which is a wonderful family oriented and quiet neighborhood.  Jessica was extremely accommodating and had laid out waters, robes and any necessities that one might require.  We only met her one time and it didn't feel like either party intruded on the other whatsoever.  The description is very accurate the room, kitchen and bathroom were kept spotless.  The bed was a memory foam and extremely comfortable.  Easy and plentiful parking.  The only slight downside is having to go outside, on the deck which is fairly private, a few steps to the glass doors leading to the kitchen and bathroom.  We would definitely stay there again.

3242605;28103528;2015-03-17;8778001;Danielle;"The Zen Den is exactly as described; warm and cozy and quiet. Though we did not have a chance to meet, Jessica was incredibly helpful and lovely to interact with; very responsive and accommodating. Would stay here again in a heartbeat - hopefully we will!"
3242605;28405713;2015-03-23;27928896;Brittany;The Zen Den was beautiful! Incense, robes, slippers, and shampoo & soap were set out neatly for us! You have to go outside to access the main house and bathroom, but it's only a 3 second walk. Had some issues connecting to the Wi-Fi, but overall our experience was great and I would recommend the Zen Den to my friends!
3242605;28585618;2015-03-26;28247908;Anya;The Zen Den was a perfect retreat for us. Close enough to the city to bike (not for beginners), drive or bus easily and the house and neighborhood were quiet and peaceful. Right down the street from a nice strip of stores and food. We had breakfast at easy street cafe which was great and about a 10 minute walk from the house. When we arrived the room was very clean and smelt nice! The bathroom and kitchen were accessible and also clean! There are cats in the house and outside which were all very friendly! I would definitely stay here again. I don't think the location and price can be beat.
3242605;28640850;2015-03-27;30026617;Lachlan;"It was a pleasure staying at Jessica's Zen Den.
My 17 month son was very excited to see all the cats everywhere."
3242605;28702414;2015-03-29;26380820;Amanda;The Zen Den was accurately described. The room is very tranquil and comfortable. Jessica left us a nice gift basket. Great overall experience! And the cats in the main house were a huge plus
3242605;28969269;2015-04-01;30021078;Kirsten;We loved our little stay at the Zen Den.  The room felt very welcoming and cozy and although we only met Jessica once, she was very accommodating!  The neighborhood was extremely quiet with beautiful houses surrounding the area and a somewhat short walk towards a few parks near the coast as well as walking distance to many restaurants and shops.  Keep in mind it is a private room but you have to walk a few steps to the main house for the restroom and kitchen!  I would recommend the zen den to my friends in a heartbeat.
3242605;29350568;2015-04-06;30176404;Adam;We stayed in the Zen Den for 3 nights over a long weekend and this was our first airbnb experience! Communication with Jessica prior to arrival was pleasant. When we arrived the room was clean, inviting and all ready and looked identical to the photos in the listing. At first we were a little leery with the shared bathroom/kitchen but became comfortable quickly due to the inviting atmosphere. We loved the cats and there was usually one wanting in or out.  There’s lots of shopping and restaurants within walking distance and we had breakfast at the Easy Street Café. A quick bus ride downtown was also only steps away. The neighborhood felt very safe and is really beautiful with lots of older interesting character homes. Our dog also had a nice stay in the Zen Den.  I would definitely stay here again if we were in Seattle. Great first airbnb experience!
3242605;29651684;2015-04-10;2686038;Vincenzo;The house was easy to find and Jessica's directions were helpful as far as getting into the room and using the main house. Loved the cats. Loved the sauna. The the west Seattle area. 
3242605;30010022;2015-04-15;1196308;Oasishostel;The place was fantastic, probably one of the best places I have stayed at. Loved the room and the location. We found a fantastic Phó place after a recommendation from Jessica's brother. I liked the whole set up and would definitely stay there again!
3242605;30165180;2015-04-18;17736983;Alex;Fantastic space. Real close to the Junction in West Seattle. Nice and quiet. Jessica made us feel welcome and she has a lovely home. Would stay again!
3242605;30428451;2015-04-21;30694717;Ian;I felt very welcome at the Zen Den! I would definitely recommend this place for a relaxing spot in West Seattle. The location is great!
3242605;31467132;2015-05-05;13485744;Aubrey;The zen den was very comfy and clean. Lots of great restaurants very close, and beautiful views around you. 
3242605;31611571;2015-05-07;32226665;Melissa;Easy to find and clear directions, a note and key we're waiting for us when we arrived. Really clean and comfortable and exactly what we were expecting. Perfect little retreat! West Seattle was gorgeous, and only half an hour to get down town via the c line. 
3242605;31963810;2015-05-12;3918114;Johan;"My stay at Jessica's Zen Den was amazing!!  The location was great and Jessica was an amazing host!  I was unsure of my time of arrival and arrived half an hour early but she was extremely accommodating :)
The sauna was a great plus and I can't wait to stay there again!  "
3242605;32776192;2015-05-21;32568947;Jenna;I felt extremely welcomed and the room was exactly as described. Very quiet, very relaxing and so close to Alaska Junction. Got a chance to try the sauna and I miss it already! Beautiful views as soon as you step outside. 
3242605;32915481;2015-05-23;21334176;Tricia;Jessica's Zen Den was a quiet, tranquil retreat in a great location. The room was perfectly sized for 2 and Jessica left us a sweet note, along with some essential necessities that were definitely an extra bonus. You can tell she takes great care in hosting and it really made us feel at home.
3242605;33694360;2015-05-31;32132569;Mitchell;The room was all set up for us when we got there, and it was cozy just like the photos. We were just stopping through and it was the perfect place to rest and recharge. Warm and comfortable, the den will bring you right back to earth. Jessica was so inviting, and makes her home available to you without any issues. Thanks for a wonderful stop Jessica! 
3242605;34070064;2015-06-04;20084321;Luna;Jessica's place is as accurate as the photos. It's clean and quiet. She is a great host and our communication was very smooth. 
3242605;34706890;2015-06-11;31539716;Laura;The host made us feel welcome. She left us a nice note even though she was out of town when we arrived. The listing was accurate. The room was just the right size for the two of us. The neighborhood was quiet and very close to California Ave, which had plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores, and stores. 
3242605;35108283;2015-06-15;33052980;Jessica;We had a great time staying at Jessica's place. Her home is very eccentric but welcoming. As a cat lover I loved seeing all of her cats in the main house. My only complaint is that the wifi signal was at times poor in our room, but this wasn't a huge issue. Jessica was very welcoming and prompt with answering all of our questions. I would definitely stay here again. Great place, great location.  
3242605;35410237;2015-06-18;34616579;Ena;Great stay, only thing is the main house had a very strong cat odor so people with allergies be aware. 
3242605;36009002;2015-06-24;30841536;Trazia;Jessica was friendly and mostly absent. There are other adults around but they keep to themselves.  We traveled with cats so it worked fine that her 4 cats have free roam. Easy access to the kitchen and bathroom.
3242605;36282100;2015-06-27;32520900;Aria;Jessica's place was welcoming and clean. The room is private and beautifully decorated. Though we didn't end up utilizing the sauna, the fact that it was there was a real treat. The house was easy to find (we traveled on foot) and in a great neighborhood that offers great views and cool eateries within easy walking distance. Jessica had a welcome note and key waiting for us upon arrival. The bed is super comfy and we felt welcome to use the bathroom and kitchen space in the house. The kitties were friendly and didn't enter the room without being invited, which we did because we liked them. Though we didn't get to meet Jessica due to a later than expected arrival and early departure, all of our questions were answered quickly via text and we never felt that we lacked anything. Excellent stay in a funky Seattle neighborhood. We will definitely stay here again when we have more time to explore the city!
3242605;36688628;2015-06-30;30558459;Sabrina;"I didn't get to meet Jessica (coming and going at different times of day) but she made sure I got into the suite okay and had everything I needed. 
It is in a great neighborhood and easy to find. 
The room was nice and cool in the hot summer heat. I wish it was cool enough outside to want to use the sauna...next time! 
The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of space. 
I loved visiting with the cats who were always around to great me on the deck (I have 2 of my own).  
She had lots of little extras in room and (email hidden) case you traveled lighter than you planned!"
3242605;36988999;2015-07-03;35816512;Vivian;Jessica was a wonderful host!,was very promt answering all my questions. As soon as we walked in left me a cute card and the keys to her wonderful den with amazing little sauna inside. My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised. She has an awesome backyard with friendly cats , they were so cute :), also very conveniently located to some local spots! My bf and I walked to this awesome spot for breakfast and vinyl shopping called easy street records. Anyways this was truly an amazing stay! I would stay here again. Thanks Jessica!,your fantastic.
3242605;37289372;2015-07-06;13308404;Monica;Wonderful place! Perfect location and A lot of privacy! We'd stay again :) 
3242605;37659160;2015-07-09;29658656;Breanne;We loved our stay at Jessica's - the room is such a perfect space! The setup is perfect and sophisticated. It is a very short walk from the bus that will take you downtown (the C) and it's near little shops and cafes. We only met briefly but Jessica is a wonderful host and you're always greeted by at least one cat anytime you are coming or going. :)
3242605;38134738;2015-07-13;17844379;Anastasia;We didn't actually meet Jessica, which I assume was just part of the undisturbed zen experience, but she was very nice over messages and she left a nice letter in the room with all the necessary info and tons of little shampoos/lotions/etc. It's a real little spa experience! The room is a little smaller than it appears in the photo, but it's still sizable and the bed is actually bigger than it appears, and a good bed is really all anyone needs! Her laundry machine was broken, which isn't a big deal in of itself, but considering we were coming to the close of a 3 week road trip and she knew of our situation, it would have been nice to know of this ahead of time since it was inevitable we'd want to use it. Of course that's minor, and overall we had a great stay! It's a great room with a great zen feeling and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking to relax!
3242605;38592003;2015-07-17;24850167;Andrew;Had a really nice time staying in the zen den. Room had a relaxing atmosphere and everything was clean and tidy. Didn't get to meet Jessica while we were there, but she replied to messages quickly and was very helpful when we had trouble with the internet connection. Would definitely stay again.
3242605;38702556;2015-07-18;31166419;Brianna;Our stay was great. The room looks exactly like the pictures. It was easy to find (both house and room) and Jessica left instructions for the bathroom/kitchen which made it even easier as we arrived quite late and left pretty early! 
3242605;39400651;2015-07-23;7278160;Lin;"We didn't get to meet Jessica but she left us a welcoming card and key. The room was as described and the neighbourhood was nice - quiet but close to restaurants and cafes. We felt slightly uncomfortable using the kitchen and bathroom without actually having met the owner but we found everything we needed.

3242605;41271041;2015-08-05;10134755;Kelly;Though I actually did not get to meet Jessica, my stay at her place was great!  The in-room sauna after a long day can not be beat.  The room is very quaint and relaxing and the location very close to many downtown shops and amenities, walking around was not a problem.   Overall great airbnb set up. 
3242605;41362197;2015-08-07;26177392;Gray;Very cozy environment, excellent stay for my first night in Seattle.

3242605;41741734;2015-08-09;4719034;Wendy;Jessica was very accommodating and let us leave our luggage in her place before checkin.  She even left us a handwritten card welcoming us.
3242605;42143331;2015-08-11;29545825;Zachary;"We very much enjoyed our stay in the Zen Den! Jessica was a most gracious host and sure made us feel welcome. The space was clean, quiet, and pleasant, just what we were looking for! It was a quick walk to Alaska Junction with plenty of eateries, shopping, bars, etc. We also walked down to Alki beach, a bit more of a hike but definitely doable if you're up for a long walk. 
Excellent host, beautiful space, great neighborhood, and affordable stay. We would most definitely stay again and recommend this space to anyone who wishes to visit West Seattle. Thanks Jessica! "
3242605;42676333;2015-08-15;4462648;Kaylee;Jessica's Zen Den was great! It was in a very convenient location of West Seattle - only a few blocks walk away from Alaska Junction. My mother and I enjoyed our stay immensely! The room had a very comfortable bed and was very private. We never saw Jessica, but when I texted her a few questions she responded promptly and was very caring and considerate. Overall, a great stay!
3242605;42841336;2015-08-16;29251713;Amanda;This place is awesome! Walking distance to bars, breweries and shops but tucked away and quiet. LOVED the sauna!! Maybe the comfiest bed we slept on our entire trip ... might have been a cloud?? Just lovely. Thanks so much, Jessica!!
