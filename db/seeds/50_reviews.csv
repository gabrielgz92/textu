8974302,39624554,2018-04-03,11508,John,Cute and cozy place. Perfect location to everything!
8974302,39624555,2018-04-06,11509,Karen,"Kelly has a great room in a very central location.
Beautiful building , architecture and a style that we really like.
We felt quite at home here and wish we had spent more time.
Went for a walk and found Seattle Center with a major food festival in progress. What a treat.
Visited the Space Needle and the Chihuly Glass exhibit. Then Pikes Place Market. WOW.  Thanks for a great stay."
8974302,39624556,2018-04-09,11510,James,"Very spacious apartment, and in a great neighborhood.  This is the kind of apartment I wish I had!
Didn't really get to meet Kelly until I was on my out, but she was always readily available by phone.
I believe the only ""issue"" (if you want to call it that) was finding a place to park, but I sincerely doubt its easy to park anywhere in a residential area after 5 pm on a Friday"
8974302,39624557,2018-04-16,11511,Brian,"Close to Seattle Center and all it has to offer - ballet, theater, museum, Space Needle, restaurants of all ilk just blocks away, and the Metropolitan (probably the coolest grocer you'll ever find). Easy to find and Kelly was warm, welcoming, and really interesting to talk to. "
8974302,39624558,2018-04-21,11512,Kim,"Kelly was a great host and very accommodating in a great neighborhood. She has some great coffee and while I wasn't around much during my stay the time I spent interacting with her was very pleasant.
The apartment is in a great location and very close to the Seattle Center. The neighborhood itself has a lot of good food as well!"
8974302,39624559,2018-05-03,11513,Johnny,"Kelly was great, place was great, just what I was looking for-
clean, simple, well kept place.
5 min walk to the Seattle bike share (as of Aug 2015) which I used all week."
8974302,39624560,2018-05-09,11514,Sophia,Kelly was great! Very nice and the neighborhood and place to stay was expected and comfortable. Overall great and would book again.
8974302,39624561,2018-05-16,11515,Gabriel,"Kelly's place is conveniently located on a quiet street in Lower Queen Anne which is an easy walk or bus/cab ride to Belltown and Downtown in addition to being a booming neighborhood in its own right. Alas, I was visiting my job and old friends in Seattle so my schedule was completely full and I barely got to meet Kelly. Which is too bad, she seemed great!"
8974302,39624562,2018-05-26,11516,Tom,"The place was really nice, clean and quiet at night.
Clean Linen and Towels were provided and the air mattress was superb.
The neighbourhood is practical with a lot of restaurants and cafes around. Downtown is reachable by foot (30 min) or bus (10 min).
Kelly was a fantastic host, although I was working most of the time, so I haven't had time to talk much to her."
8974302,39624563,2018-06-01,11517,Sheila ,"The listing was exactly as described!  Kelly's place was wonderful and clean.  it was just what we were looking for.
We only got to meet her for a moment one evening because of our varied schedule, but she was warm and welcoming to us.
Her place is also in good walking distance to City Center!  Lots to do right around there!
We would recommend her place to others who are traveling to Seattle!"
8974302,39624564,2018-06-09,11518,Paal,Very welcoming and a nicer place to live in the Seattle area
8974302,39624565,2018-06-14,11519,Eu-Loong,"Great location, great price, great host! Thanks for the wine, coffee and interesting conversation. You'll definitely see me again when I visit next."
8974302,39624566,2018-06-22,11520,Olivia,"Staying at Kelly's was easy. The location was a block away from public transportation, her place was easy to find, keys were easy to access and timing was extremely flexible. Great for the price - nothing too fancy. One negative: the shower didn't drain well. "
8974302,39624567,2018-07-03,11521,Daniel,Kelly was an amazing host who made the stay very pleasurable. Her location is ideal for anyone visiting Seattle. Highly recommended
8974302,39624568,2018-07-05,11522,Max,"Despite our late booking request, Kelly was very responsive and helpful over email. It was a great place to stay - the location was ideal, the house was clean, well-furnished, the room was cozy, and the cat made good company. Overall, a lovely experience and I would definitely recommend the Farmhouse! "
8974302,39624569,2018-07-11,11523,Kevin,Kelly has a nice house closed to downtown. The room was clean. The kitten is really nice and friendly. A good place to stay!
8974302,39624570,2018-07-16,11524,Sarah,"Kelly has been the perfect hosts for us. Our schedule was very tight and she has been very helpful for the check-in and the reservation.
The house is conveniently located, spacious, and beautiful. The room has space for luggages or coats in a big closet. You are given a spare key, so you're free to go in and out.
We have felt really comfortable with our hosts and really recommend this house as a place to stay if you're going to Seattle."
8974302,39624571,2018-07-24,11525,Rachel,"This house was a delightful bright place to stay! Kelly was so nice, they had breakfast for us in the morning. And when we arrived their lovely cat Brigette greeted us and made everything cozy!"
8974302,39624572,2018-08-03,11526,Ben,"Beautiful place, nice neighborhood and lovely hose & cat!
Would definitely sleep there again!"
8974302,39624573,2018-08-11,11527,Craig,"Super cozy home. Located near some good restaurants and bars. The only time we really spent at the house was while we were sleeping because we were busy sightseeing on our only day in Seattle, but we would love to stay there again. The cat was an added bonus!
The only downside was that their room was right next to ours so we felt like we needed to be extra quiet. We also had to wake up very early and we felt bad that Kelly’s room was right next to ours, but I'm sure they're used to it!
Another bonus was that they had wonderful looking bread and beverages available for us in the morning, but unfortunately we didn't have time to enjoy them! "
8974302,39624574,2018-08-19,11528,Lee,"Cute house, and Kelly was a super nice host.  Very prompt communication, clean, comfortable rooms, simple and relaxing decor. Thanks guys!"
8974302,39624575,2018-08-22,11529,Ali,"Kelly was a really great host. Warm, welcoming, and friendly. I felt immediately at ease in their place. The space was very comfortable, clean, and as advertised. She knows a lot about Seattle, so are good resources to have when you are there. Her cat is friendly and amusing. I would definitely stay here again! Highly recommended. "
8974302,39624576,2018-08-28,11530,Oliver,"The house was easy to locate and the arrangement to get in works fine even the host was not there when I arrived.
Everything consistent with the description and Kelly has provided useful information to get around the area.
It takes a bit more than expected to walk to the downtown though. "
8974302,39624577,2018-09-03,11531,Will,"Kelly was a very obliging host, super friendly and communicative. She gave us valuable tips to explore Seattle and even invited us to go to a concert with her - a super experience! The room and the bed provided enough space for two, very comfortable furthermore. The bathroom and the kitchen were clean and we could find everything we needed. All in all a wonderful stay, there was nothing to complain about at all!"
8974302,39624578,2018-09-11,11532,Sam,"What a great stay at Kelly’s! She was accommodating hosts and we felt instantly at ease in her home. She was very kind letting our group of four stay at her home, and very flexible with check-in and check-out times.
The house is warm, charming, and located in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance of many of Seattle's sights. "
8974302,39624579,2018-09-16,11533,Callum,We had an amazing time and felt very welcome in Kelly’s beautiful home. The location was perfect and we could easily walk to one of Seattle's coolest areas. Our room was peaceful and the bed was very comfortable. Overall we had a fantastic stay and would highly recommend this place to anyone.
8974302,39624580,2018-09-26,11534,Ned,"It was very easy to get in touch with Kelly to book a space in her beautiful home. She was a very gracious host who shared her morning coffee with us while she was getting ready for work. Our room was very cozy and the rest of the house is open & beautifully decorated - if we didn't have other plans it would have been easy to lounge there all day, especially with their friendly kitty! The farmhouse is located in a great neighborhood that is quite easy to access the city - because the weather was so wonderful during our stay, my friend & I walked to the downtown waterfront which only took about 35 minutes. I would highly recommend staying here - I will again when I return to Seattle."
8974302,39624581,2018-10-02,11535,Alex,"Kelly’s home is beautiful and inspiring! We were only there for a brief time but they made us feel at home. And Brigitte, the cat, is the friendliest cat I've ever met.
The location is very convenient, barely 2 miles from downtown and Capitol Hill.
Also, You'll have fun browsing through some of the interesting art + doodads around the house"
8974302,39624582,2018-10-06,11536,Becky,"Kelly was a great host. We arrived, opened the lock box, and found our room with no trouble. The neighborhood was quiet but Capitol Hill restaurants and bars were easily accessible. Coffee, fruit, and nuts were left in the kitchen for guests and were greatly appreciated. For a quiet night in Seattle, the Farmhouse is a great option with a very sweet cat!"
8974302,39624583,2018-10-13,11537,Claire,"Kelly was very friendly and flexible. Kelly had baked us some homemade cookies that tasted fantastic after a 7 hr flight to Seattle. Thank you!! The room was great and spot on with the description. There was free wifi and a list of recommended spots to check out while in Seattle. Very clean house and safe neighborhood.
Their cat is very friendly as well! Five star cat ^_^
Kelly was very flexible about check out time. It helped us a lot since our flight wasn't until later that night.
The location is great! near the downtown area.  I highly recommend this place."
8974302,39624584,2018-10-16,11538,Molly,"Kelly was a gracious host and, though we met her only shortly, she was very friendly. We slept comfortably in the Corner room, that is simply furnished and a bit chilly at night, but also quite private and quiet. They offer complimentary fruit, nuts and drinks for breakfast, which was very nice, especially since they had a dairy-free alternative (delicious hazelnut milk) for lactose-intolerant people like me. "
8974302,39624585,2018-10-24,11539,Matt,"I felt very welcome at Kelly’s house, even though I wasn't able to check in until late. House matched the description, clean and comfortable room, and a very nice cat."
8974302,39624586,2018-11-04,11540,Ming,"Great little home! I felt very, very welcome, ad ended hanging out with Kelly quite a bit. And the cat was just dreamy."
8974302,39624587,2018-11-09,11541,Todd,Kelly and the cat were both awesome host and people to meet as well as their sweet kitty. Kelly was there to greet me and even provide guidance on where to visit and directions. Both of them were very sweet and great for insider tips. The place was very convenient and clean. Enjoyed my stay in Seattle. Thank yoU!!
8974302,39624588,2018-11-13,11542,Chris,Kelly was really great and her place is clean and comfy. And their cat is so friendly! Good location and great hosts. Absolutely recommend.
8974302,39624589,2018-11-19,11543,Lochlan,"Kelly was awesome! I felt welcomed the second I stepped foot in their home. It was almost like I was staying with friends of my own. I had never been to Seattle before, but the insight they gave me about what there is to experience around the city helped shaped my vacation for the best.
As far as the house itself -- it was beautiful, clean, filled with great art and lush plants.. Just like the photos! The only evidence of their cat was Brigitte herself. There wasn't any pet odor or hair to be found. The house has amazing natural lighting as well. But not to worry, the bedroom has a very heavy curtain for blocking out the morning sun for sleeping in as long as you please. The comfy bed was a great thing to come back to each night after a long day of exploring. Located in the Central District (literally central to everything), I was able to walk everywhere I wanted to go and felt very safe doing so.
They have set the bar extremely high for any future Airbnb experiences. I will definitely try to book with Rachel and Jon the next time I travel to Seattle, and will recommend their listing to everyone I know! "
8974302,39624590,2018-12-04,11544,Jack,"Easy to find and park, close to downtown and the places we needed to go; super convenient! It was also very comfortable, and we especially enjoyed Brigitte, the friendliest cat in the world! We would stay there again in a heartbeat and would love talking to our hosts more."
8974302,39624591,2018-12-08,11545,Dylan,"Kelly was amazing! Sweet sweet duo, with an amazingly sweet sweet kitty, and a cool place in a pretty darn convenient location. Thanks so much for opening your house to us!"
8974302,39624592,2018-12-17,11546,Emiel,We had a wonderful stay at Kelly’s home. They were great hosts and the location was great - walking distance to downtown and a short cab ride away. Highly recommended!
8974302,39624593,2018-12-23,11547,Lisa,"Rachel was a great host and the room/house was great.  While we were out exploring most of our time there, we felt right at home and at ease where we were staying.
The neighborhood is just a mile walk (or cheap Uber ride) from downtown Seattle and the same for Capitol Hill area.
If cats are an issue - don't worry.   I can be sometimes sensitive to cat hair - but you would never know there was a cat in the house.  But she is super sweet but also not in the way if you don't want her to be - but she does like a good petting :)"
8974302,39624594,2018-01-05,11548,Nicole,"They were really great!  We got in very late because of a delayed flight, but they didn't mind one bit.  They were both very friendly and really cool to talk to.  We were only there one night on our way up to B.C. but I would have loved to stay with them longer.  Awesome house in a great neighborhood.  Plus, they have a really dope cat.  Highly recommend.  "
8974302,39624595,2018-01-11,11549,Jess,"I had a great experience staying at the Farmhouse! Kelly (and the kitty) were incredibly sweet and accommodating. They let me drop my bags off several hours early so I could make the most of my day exploring Seattle. It was so nice to be able to come and go as I pleased. The house was safe, clean, and down right adorable. As my first Airbnb experience, the bar has been set pretty high!"
8974302,39624596,2018-01-19,11550,Amy,"Kelly made us feel totally welcome.  She was in close contact with me on the day of our arrival.  Her home is exceptionally beautiful, and our bed was very comfy.  She did everything possible to keep the place cool (in 95 degree heat!) and offered great suggestions for food and fun in Seattle.  Oh yeah, and the cat was also very cuddly and lovable!"
8974302,39624597,2018-02-05,11551,Anna,"Kelly’s house is a very nice classic Seattle house in a great location. We were there in the middle of a heat wave but the house still kept cool, even though it was 95+ out we had no trouble even napping midday in our comfy room. She left treats and snack out and had a very friendly cat that we enjoyed napping with. We missed paths on the way in but met up on the way out and lo and behold we knew each other from high school! We had a great time sipping coffee and catching up and will definitely check back in for future Seattle trips."
8974302,39624598,2018-02-15,11552,Carol,"incredible host! She was both very friendly, open, easy going and her hospitality was far more than I could have ever hoped for. She offered tips of where to go, what to do, where to shop and how to find what I was looking for. She even shared the fruits of their labour blueberry picking, and helped me make coffee in the morning. It made my first weekend of school that much more enjoyable knowing I was returning to somewhere that felt like home."
8974302,39624599,2018-02-19,11553,Sandra,"This was my very first stay at an Airbnb and it was lovely.  I chose the Corner Room at the Farmhouse because of its proximity to my daughter's apartment.  Kelly was very nice and made me feel welcome in her home.  The bed was extremely comfortable, so I slept great, and I learned how to use the French Press to make coffee.  The house is clean and sunny in a nice neighborhood.
I will definitely stay at The Corner Room again the next time I visit."
8974302,39624600,2018-01-24,11554,Peng,"Kelly was a terrible host and her home was filthy. In terms of location it’s right inbetween downtown and Capitol Hill so commuting was almost impossible. Her communication was terrible.
Avoid at all costs!"
8974302,39624601,2018-03-14,11555,Darrel,"Kelly was an amazing host and immediately opened her hospitality to my boyfriend and I. She welcomed us into her apartment and gave us the run down on Seattle. She even went out of her way and provided for us a huge and informative lists of many of the highlights of Seattle. My boyfriend and I really wanted to experience the coffee, beer, and food scene of Seattle, and Kelli covered it all perfectly!
The location was perfect and ideal for first timers in Seattle. Pike Place and the Seattle Center  (Space Needle and Chihuly) were just a short walk away.  Fremont was also a slightly longer walk north from Kelli's. Lastly, Kerri Park where you can receive one of the best views of the Seattle skyline was also very close!
Overall Kelly was a phenomenal host and I highly recommend her for anyone visiting Emerald City!"
8974302,39624602,2018-03-21,11556,Simon,"First and foremost Kelly went out of her way to install a keybox to make this whole trip way more convenient. It's apparent she cares about those she hosts.
When we arrived the apartment was clean and comfy. We found our cozy bedroom to be very accommodating. My wife and I had no problems sleeping with the futon that was folded out. It was surprisingly comfortable. Kelli provided pillows, towels, and everything we needed for the night. The room's decoration was really cool.
The neighborhood was great and we didn't feel like we needed to go far for anything we needed. Attending PAX was a breeze.
When we finally met Kelli on the final morning she was warm and welcoming. We got to meet her dog who is a little bundle of love. I have no reservations about staying with Kelli again."
8974302,39624603,2018-04-05,11557,Paul,Convenient location close to Music Museum. Easy to find. Nice and tidy.  Host gave us a lot of good suggestions of vegetarian places to eat and punk bars. Turns out we had lots in common.
8974302,39624604,2018-04-13,11558,Ruby,"Amazing stay, great place and a cool host! I would recommend this to anyone!"
